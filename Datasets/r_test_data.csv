"KU_O5udG6zpxOg-VcAEodg",3,"If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. 

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.","2018-07-07 22:09:11"
"BiTunyQ73aT9WBnpR9DZGw",5,"I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!","2012-01-03 15:28:18"

Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.","2014-02-05 20:30:30"

Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.","2017-01-14 20:54:15"

"6AxgBCNX_PNTOxmbRSwcKQ",5,"Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!","2015-01-03 23:21:18"

"ZKvDG2sBvHVdF5oBNUOpAQ",3,"This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.","2016-03-30 22:46:33"
"pUycOfUwM8vqX7KjRRhUEA",3,"Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.","2016-07-25 07:31:06"
"rGQRf8UafX7OTlMNN19I8A",5,"My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. 
I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!
The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.","2015-06-21 14:48:06"

"UBp0zWyH60Hmw6Fsasei7w",4,"The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. 

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. 

I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. 

Super cheap and you can drive through.","2011-10-27 17:12:05"

Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet.

Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work.

"ZVvhc3Go7v5I8XTiVoWmqQ",3,"Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.","2014-11-12 14:12:20"

"lUUhg8ltDsUZ9h0xnwY4Dg",4,"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.
The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.","2018-07-17 03:30:07"

"pHwbdway4yeI-dSSmZA7-Q",4,"We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.","2017-09-20 16:16:47"

"YcLXh-3UC9y6YFAI9xxzPQ",4,"The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. 
I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.","2015-03-05 03:37:54"

When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said ""oh that's only Pepsi"".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  
We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  
It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  
When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.

We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.

For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.

We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai!

I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.","2012-10-08 19:32:44"

"4zopEEPqfwm-c_FNpeHZYw",5,"We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.","2016-05-31 02:14:54"
"-7LkjSPzfVgnVpuVuRuOow",5,"I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.","2008-12-03 04:13:43"

This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. 

More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. 

It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!","2011-11-30 06:58:36"

All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.

"JzBhoRVecH9pO0BBiJNQqw",3,"I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:

- We were staying a nearby hotel.
- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.
- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.
- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!
- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.
- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...
- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. 
- Clean the bathroom!!

Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.","2017-01-02 04:12:17"

We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us.

All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking ""oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!""  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!

Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB). 

In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.","2012-05-29 03:51:08"
"940tqxFO4Pwg_KMg4Y4Z5g",5,"Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada.

No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. 

My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.

To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. 

Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)","2012-07-16 13:25:18"

"UD0AKHQQHSzYsbCkdM7Xrw",4,"I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. 

But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. 

Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.","2012-03-30 20:57:29"

Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time.

They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.","2015-11-18 22:25:22"
"Lj1TAURE_hYtPW3IlhKWMg",5,"Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.","2015-02-16 14:00:30"
"wsFRDsHxz2mM_Ettgn1qQg",4,"We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!

The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! 

Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!","2017-06-28 01:07:04"

It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.
  The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she ""loves Tom Jones"". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like. 
   I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the ""loud"" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.

"q22lpVDGRGiglEUqjdbA4A",2,"I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ

Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, ""pulled"" pork was moist.

Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.","2012-05-28 17:55:04"

"a5JHzBrWxRd_OmIvV7znDA",1,"Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this

    Roast Beef
    Roast Beef Combo
    Roast Pork
    Roast Pork Combo
    Baked Ham
    Baked Ham Combo
    Roast Turkey
    Roast Turkey Combo
    Broccoli Rabe
    Broccoli Rabe Combo


No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)

The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  

When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.

I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.

The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.","2014-11-12 12:41:29"

I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.

"HSjRz31mvRBQRo8deXrr_w",2,"Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.","2013-08-03 16:26:48"
"kj5pjfid6pUP818rF0q6GQ",4,"This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it. We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. 

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave.

Pure staff met with me to discuss my budget and offered beautiful, unique flower and arrangement selections. Their estimate came in well within my budget. Their staff was always professional and their expertise was obvious. The day of the event, they created such a gorgeous space with all the beautiful arrangements - our guests raved about them, even days after the event was over! I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.

I had a bison burger. that was the only reason I went there.  Seems we had 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 burger, 1 bison burger and split a large fry, for about $37.  Rather ridiculous. And they try to hard to be different or interesting, but ruin a good meal.  The bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and BBQ on it to call it a Carolina bison burger.

The black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. 

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. 

This entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. 

No one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled.

Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.","2016-11-22 05:02:55"

They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave!

No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.

As soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).

Typically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.

"6I8MMW6gsBWSWNXFf3MUdg",5,"Let me preface by saying that I have been getting my hair cut by a guy in Austin for seven years, even though I've lived in other cities for half that time. He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.

My friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said ""look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days."" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.

Allison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.

One of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign.

"bVgpM_sA9AMAlL2R5TPNAQ",1,"Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back.","2017-05-13 16:53:19"
"ymir0baPnU0rYEo_VBZxvA",4,"I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal. 

I also use them for take out/delivery. I have always enjoyed the way the package their food, in plastic containers that I use over and over again until they look too worn out and I recycle them. I hate take out places that use so much boxes and cups and card board - it's extremely eco-unfriendly. 

The food here is never spectacular but is a good standby you will always come away enjoying. The prices seem a little steep but the restaurant atmosphere is contemporary, the service has always been splendid and the food is dependable.","2009-08-04 19:09:02"

Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. 

Negatives:
- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.
-Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. 
- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. 
- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. 
-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. 
-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa! 

Only Positive:
-They have a few modern pieces.

I think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here, wait for a holiday sale.","2012-03-30 05:25:31"

The katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.

The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. 

I'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.","2018-02-23 22:49:01"

The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger, lime, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.

This particular Skyline, however, is not great.  The service is generally poor, and the food comes out very slowly.

Even worse, in the next morning before I was gonna take my family out for a trip, I found my car had no wiper fluid; hence I had no choice but went back and waste another hour waiting them to refill it.

The car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th), and still, I was still charged for underage fee, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.

The last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.

We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!

The hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!

The rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!

The brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! 

Finally, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander.  Nick and Will treated us like their own family.  They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable.  Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block.  The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating.

I liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.

Another taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.

"1nwMNWObHn1Aq-Yv2LTJQw",3,"You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry, tiring wait to get a seat. 

We tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave.

The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. 

Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos.

"X-CWXNjxwaqHwSME0Q3KpA",2,"Terrace Lounge appears to want to have a great cocktail venue, but they fall short.  One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.  Peppermill, if you want to create a cool cocktail bar, ditch the machines, train your staff, or hire bartenders with better service skills, and buy some independent liquors.","2013-08-04 00:44:00"

"0trQZcvI12ONojsrEOnIHQ",4,"Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  

The egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.

The pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.

The server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.

All around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!","2013-02-21 20:40:05"

We paid 35 dollars for the ""piano guys"" to sing a song to the birthday girl. We had 3 options of songs that we wanted to hear. They called our birthday girl on stage and began to sing a rendition of Aladins whole new world. (Which was not one of the songs we had picked) The song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. The piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs,tying her up, filling holes, splurging on her face, and cumming in her hair. It was even worse than that. Her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn't hear to well because the sound system is terrible. Our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. It was disgusting, offensive, and embarrassing. Trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. It completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. We spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. Also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang  part of.","2016-03-07 02:39:09"
"hozoa1DsTCjpz4UC8YGsNw",4,"The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

Next, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3.","2012-10-08 15:29:44"

Everything was made to order, cooked to perfection and came out hot.  

The family also opened a cafe in front of the restaurant. Jose gave us a tour and introduced us to his daughter that runs the cafe.

"upZ4kUcTgNnpeCp9ijUgIQ",3,"Husband and I made a mistake and came here on a Lenten Friday. The wait was forever. But since we were already there, might as well suck it up and see what's it all about. We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice.","2013-03-18 21:33:19"

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut","2013-07-12 20:44:45"

We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. ""It was totally worth it,"" he later told me, ""Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.""

All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert.

The atmosphere was inviting with a hip feel if that's what you're looking for.  What was really annoying was the parking situation. For a place with price points such as these and limited parking spaces, a valet service should be provided either at a cost or complimentary.  Don't even try and park in the back of the building, it's tight and dangerous even getting there and back.

I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   

So go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.","2011-08-25 16:14:24"

They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell.

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.

"FpWzaYsVDGrU8w3134s1jg",4,"Nice little bar located at the very far end of Terminal E and Tampa International. The airport recently added several new restaurants with a ""local vibe"" and this is one of them. There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly.

"Q7sc8JXBOfA0gqKObNWsnA",1,"Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.","2013-11-14 10:28:34"

"qeSxL-POvGLZD6aQ5O9kvw",1,"--------DINNER REVIEW----------

I rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. 

We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.

It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. 

After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). 

After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. 

Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. 

They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...

In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. 

I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.","2017-09-09 00:09:15"

It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.
Next we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,
If I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow","2014-02-23 23:59:50"

In Tampa, the International Plaza Mall has this temporary store from Thanksgiving to Easter. They located very close to H&M clothing store. You can have samples before you buy it. I got the lollipop candies. I also bought one assorted chocolate candies. They are very good. The store clerk was kind enough to let us try their assorted chocolate other their typical sample candies. 

You can go with chocolate with nut, mint, toffee, milk, white or dark chocolate. All are good. Guilty pleasure with a touch at sweet side. Mail order through the web also available. If you close to the mall, just go to buy one without shipping.","2016-12-04 05:36:48"
"FTax2GLIJRbHbEBUE82_pA",5,"Second stop for Center City Restaurant Week:  R2L, dinner for $35 each. 

On the 37th floor of Two Liberty Place is a very fancy-cool restaurant/lounge where you can get a bird's eye view of the city! Group of us went to dinner here together after a day of meetings. Didn't get one of the tables facing the windows, but still had great views of the sunset and city by night. Again, multiple choices for the three courses, but I chose to start with the crisp peas/ham/garlic risotto [balls]. Main course was the Butcher's Filet (braised short rib + Steuben bean chili, potato/farm veg slaw and basil), which was quite heavy since there was also meat in the chili as well. The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side. A bottle of wine for the table as well. Food was great, waiter was awesome (making sure to warn me that the risotto came in ball form rather than a bowl, for instance), very classy experience.","2015-09-24 00:57:49"

"nDH6ctdQskr7_V_ot3_mVw",5,"I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  

Tahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  

My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.","2013-08-03 15:34:15"

"v6wULImVULtf6ZfFljX_4Q",3,"Uhhhhh.... Not sure how to quantify or qualify my experience here. Let's start with back story: 

My sister was visiting for the weekend, so I wanted to show her a solid night on the town that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. 
Deciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:

Friends ""Let's go to FMs"" 
Me: ""No, too much broken glass""
Friends: ""Let's go to Snake and Jake's""
Me: ""Eh....""
Friends: ""Brothers 3?""
Me: ""I'm afraid I'll hit my head on the ceiling""
Friends: ""The Saint!!""
Me: ""I suppose I haven't been there before, I'm curious.""

After entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I'm glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night.

"vSuwwwi5wcMlhRJaTgNCkw",5,"I stopped by Bell Meade during a recent visit to Nashville. The best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time I go to Nashville I will go out of my way to make sure I return to Bell Meade.

On my travels, I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year, I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example, Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.

Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T, I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.

I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all.","2015-04-01 15:45:29"
"OYrtEEEu0qLiTdwlPm9egQ",5,"I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.","2015-08-19 04:11:47"
"amIMShQBXjITXiYG6gyiaA",1,"What a disappointment. This place was not good I would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered, rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom.
The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.
 Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.

"3Qwi1Q4ea7OJPpueQVEoBQ",4,"I stayed at the Orange St location from Friday to Monday.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.

Overall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes. I forgot to mention how quiet** this place is. I loved it. I felt as if no one was there except me. Very quiet* which worked for me on Sunday bc I had lots of studying to do and two TV's to watch The Walking Dead on. Lol!

I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.

There is no ambiance or atmosphere here.  The strip mall where it's located is pretty depressing.  Desi Village may be the only active store in it.  And its decor is tired and old.  It is a big space and it appears they do a big lunch buffet but I'm curious if it's ever full.  So don't go for the ambiance.

But the food is good.  We ordered some Keema Naan, Samosas, Saag Paneer, and Lamb Biryani.  All of it was really good.  Perfectly seasoned, not too oily, and appropriately spicy.  I have a nut allergy and made them aware of that and they did not screw it up (most Indian restaurants do).  So we'll definitely be back.  It would be great if they moved into nicer digs but the food is what is most important.","2016-08-25 13:50:44"
"MWUGmzyXVIlG2NwvzX0q4Q",5,"What an AMAZING occurrence that we ended up here after another barbecue place ran out of food!

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze. I will definitely return to LA Smokehouse and I'll be adding it to my ""BBQ Favorites"" list for future reference.","2016-11-21 20:04:45"
"e4e1OLjmdLfYET_v3nEHvw",5,"After today's lunch, Iris has moved to the top of my New Orleans favorites lists--no small feat in a city where restaurants are numerous and culinary competition is fierce. Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. 

The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. 

Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. 

Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. 

All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. 

We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch. No matter the size of my group, I will definitely be returning!","2010-05-14 22:21:21"
"2xIYKNiMuDpF2wWjT1RIKg",4,"Great atmosphere and decor. Super friendly staff seat you right away. I stopped once for lunch and one time for dinner. They have some lunch specials one of which was Pad Thai. I order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this .  The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

On a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.

Half of 104th closes down to add space for a variety of food vendors and artisan vendors (art, jewelry, clothing, etc.).

Good tip: there's a gourmet mini donut truck off behind the farmers market a bit tucked away. Amazing!

It's nice to take an hour or two before or after a show to walk around and casually stumble on other street performances. Or even go without seeing a play just to snack and shop at the vendors.

Darin and Sierra have such attention to detail and quality that Darin even stopped by one of the wineries to meet us and to ensure that everything was as expected. Our driver was also extremely knowledgeable about the area and had many good suggestions throughout the day.

"3aCWNBbYgO6dv1MjUEVL0g",4,"A great spot to take out-of-town guests. I take all my Chicago friends here and they fall in love. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.

The burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. 

Another unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. 

The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done.

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.","2012-08-15 19:17:49"

I have long, fine, mostly straight Asian hair, and have had mixed results from the Aveda Institute -- to be expected considering I had a different stylist in every case.

Just know that if you haven't had a student stylist before, don't expect perfection. Do expect the cut to take an inordinately long time compared to a seasoned professional -- most of my cuts/styles have taken around 2 hours. The basic cut price includes massaging wash, cut, and blowdry style, plus the stylists do take the time to check in with their teachers and make sure the cut is going the way you want it to. Another plus: all of the stylists I've had at the Aveda Institute have been professional and committed to their service, which isn't always the case at other schools.

"IgfUV2Ggcl36kS7mv8wsaw",1,"I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.

I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. 

After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. 

After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"". 

Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.","2014-05-08 13:41:39"

The beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.

"0aC3eVgDQFE6gH2Fk-MrDg",4,"This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.","2013-11-14 01:23:03"

On my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.

Being out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.

The interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.

Our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.

For dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.

Complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). 

Overall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: 

1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.

2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.

When we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.

All in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.","2012-07-16 17:27:36"
"GXlrpVd8rnL8gMgxczbd1g",2,"Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming. When you enter, there is a large, awkward entrance and you have to go upstairs to be seated. It was probably only half full, but since it was strange weather, we decided to sit indoors. I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. 

Our server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. 

The crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well. 

All in all, stuffy and so overpriced. Bummed out!","2013-05-29 18:36:39"
"KLxHEsW1beqLqyrrNUuRqg",5,"This review is LONG overdue!  I visited Stitch-It in June 2013

In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.

Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  

Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said ""I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!""  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  

I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.","2014-05-26 17:53:55"

Low key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room. But, don't let the modest face fool you, this place rocks!

Menu is creative and fully customizable. Burgers are cooked on a flattop, perfectly seared, juicy, slightly charred. Fries are hand cut, fried fresh, perfectly crispy and salty. What more could you ask for from a burger place? 

Pro tip - Download the SPOT app for a rewards program and some good coupons (aka free fries!).","2017-08-28 23:42:14"
"8z3Pg6eksz8TAYAPLxJWIQ",5,"I really like these guys! I needed to get replacement keys made for my car since the existing ones were worn and not opening the doors consistently. I was referred by my mechanic, who said ""go see these guys. They'll take good care of you"". He was right!

My car has transponder keys that cost a mint if you get them from the dealership, or a lot less from eBay (always go eBay). While evaluating my key, they made a test copy before risking cutting on the blanks I brought them. I appreciated that caution. Even after cutting the keys, he checked that they both worked in all doors and the trunk before giving them to me. Very thorough job and great attitude. Highly recommended.","2016-05-19 05:23:05"
"H9_TfnzLl9lN_VZ5ND5_fw",5,"This is the most beautiful salon I have ever seen. It very clean an organized with an amazing friendly staff. I was given a tour by the owner Doug he is one cool dude.

Doug has an extensive resume of accomplishments as a stylist, he teaches and trains all over the world and brings his expertise and share with his salon staff by holding a weekly training in his salon to ensure his staff is up to date with the latest technique and fashions. If I would trust anybody with my hair it would be here at this place.

I would recommend this place to anybody local or is from out of town.","2011-03-20 19:53:46"
"wAM66UfeH6U3pJxuZwWzIA",5,"So delicious! I am so happy Reno is getting more variety in it's restaurants. 
Bab Cafe has a great menu, service was quick even during the lunch rush. 
I had the Dak-Galbi Bibim-bab ""teriyaki chicken."" The meat was tasty, veggies were fresh, sauces were awesome. I also ordered a side of potstickers (because I can never resist potstickers) and they were so great. 
Only wish it were a little easier to get to, being downtown parking can be a challenge.","2017-06-06 23:22:10"
"m6EMoIqkLWn01UrqVOI2yA",5,"If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans, definitely come here!

My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch, which was divine.  If you are of age, order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  

They bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.  

Definitely go to Mr. B's!","2014-03-14 04:21:30"

Just want to tell you the way the salon looks like already giving you feeling that they know what are they doing! Very clean, simple, professional. Two ladies met me at the front room, ask me about my preferences, tell me about the packages and prices they have - very understandable.  They put some information about me in the computer and i am all set for waxing!  They goes by appointments - always!! 
I did my armpits - to give it a try) My specialist were Despina!  Really really nice lady i've been pleased talking to her while she was easy with no pain taking off the hair which were really hard cause for 3-4 month i used shaving and the hair got really thick! Still it wasn't so painful cause she used the hard wax which i Loved immediately! Great job - very clean - fast and easy! And price was just 16$ which were really good deal for this quality of waxing! 
She asked me when i would like to come back for armpits an we scheduled apointment in 3 weeks! But I might go earlier for bikini! I believe it wouldn't be so painful like it was before! So i will go for it! 
As well i bought there a treat for ingrown hair!  We will see how it works)
Thank you Very much for great service! And great atmosphere! You can trust them!

Again thank you Despina!","2014-02-06 05:58:15"
"wR6Bl-Vywqd56UaogCcWNg",5,"After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes, I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the ""food truck nazi"" and that it was the best in town and found Gus, the falafel nazi, as he called himself, lived up to his reputation and more. 
As my turn came up, I approached the cart tenuously, for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses.
Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it.
There was enough food for 2 people.
Well worth the wait!","2016-10-26 15:50:57"

"Zssrl36KBW-QMHsa8G9a_w",5,"Another five-star dining review!  Fresco serves-up wonderful fresh and tasty pizza.  We tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit Tucson during the gem shows.  For what you get, their prices are very reasonable.  My husband and I were new, and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza, how it is made from all fresh ingredients, etc.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  We ordered the meat-special pizza, which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage, pepperoni, ham and bacon.  The pizza was GREAT!  Crispy AND tender crust, plenty of toppings, and a ""multiple-napkiner.""  We also had a nice talk with the young owner, and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers.  We will definitely return next year!  Do I recommend Fresco?...YOU BETCHA I DO!!!","2015-02-24 04:27:38"
"yx1IGiMSFDeuosuoRE1gpQ",3,"We went to this restaurant after running in the Philadelphia marathon.  We had a large group (12) with us including kids (ages 10-14), parents and grandparents.   The place is very clean and looks fairly new or at least newly decorated.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.  The lighting was very dim which was an issue for the grandparents reading the menu.  

The Veggie wings were great as were the cactus and sweet potato burritos.   The guacamole was very good although the spicy chips were a little too much.

They offer pitchers of margaritas which was great for our large group.","2010-11-23 13:45:24"
"h67ml8WCL7N5yhSBJtdoPw",5,"First of all, I think this might be my first Yelp review about ""fast food."" It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  

I am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!","2017-08-16 15:51:51"

"xz7n9r3Y1856-T3Xrbhs3w",1,"It is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service. The wait is endless, no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY ""dropped the ball"" on my time constraints! 

I love their stuff, but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card, do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame!","2017-12-02 21:45:32"

Eric is the type of waiter you would find a quality sit down restaurant.  The other were the 2 people at the grill house station.

"xZ-hLh7lC1lX-pC8rW3HlA",3,"Went here before a show we were seeing in the University City area.  It is just across the street from 30th Street Station, and just down the street from Drexel University.  We we able to get street parking about 2 blocks down the street, so that is always a plus.  

Service was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.","2009-10-13 23:05:04"

"e8u5K7rpzWt3CEoGmqYZNA",5,"I really enjoy this little restaurant full of goodness. Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. 

I always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very 
good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.

Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. 

The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. 

I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as ""the best food item"" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all.

It can be extremely slow. On one occasion it took them so long to get my seitan nachos out to me that they had to give them to me on the house. All of my friends were done eating and ready to leave and I was JUST getting my food! 

As for the rest of the food at El Camino, the only other thing I've tried would be the fried pickles. I have to say, I was not impressed. I love both pickles and fried things but these were not good. The coating was too grainy and I just didn't like the taste.

You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist, even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen, who I might say was very responsive.

I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind, as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.

On the wedding day, Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise, which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me.","2017-04-07 23:30:01"

"EJWyA5wpdVMji1j4TwSZqQ",5,"After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.","2010-08-20 19:16:04"

Wow... I was not disappointed!
We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).
We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.
The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...

"fFX81fVi2KpnlR7CN7ht_A",4,"My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. 

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. 

Anyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!","2018-04-15 13:21:32"

However... I would NEVER return to this place again, nor would I Ever RECOMMEND it to Anyone. 

APPETIZERS:
I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  ""BBQ sauce"" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.

The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  

I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.  

The other members of our party ordered entrees. They all said, ""This Sucks!""

THough we were greeted by a very friendly hostess, the place looked like a run down diner on the interior--and it wasn't very clean or charming.  This would have been fine because a lot of times the ""run down"" places have the best ""authentic food,"" but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.    Our server hated his life and made snarky, mean comments throughout our time there which, though entertaining, was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant.  My friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauce--unimpressive being the general adjective I would use to describe any given dish my party ordered.  I had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and ""seafood imperial"" dishes were OK at best.

Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  

For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. 

Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.

For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.

 I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.

Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.

We'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.","2017-05-26 01:02:46"

I chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh, the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad, and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.

The vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning, seasoned, pan fried vegetables, rice, and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top. The flavors were astounding, and despite a lack of desire to stuff myself silly, I did anyway. Plenty of food for lunch and very reasonably priced.","2014-01-17 01:25:31"

Our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed.  As the weeks went by, the guest list increased, so I decided I wanted a cake.  With probably less than a weeks notice, Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully, she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake ""table"".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say, for someone with not much in the decorating department, everything came out better than I could ever imagine.  And not only was the cake perfect, it was yummy delicious.  I can't wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer!

Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing.","2016-09-30 20:00:58"

If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. 
Don't waste your time or money!!!
Stay away! Any other place is better than here!","2017-10-02 22:59:04"

Their stage is really cool! Raised up, lights that move around, good sound system, a fog machine, and a pretty big dance floor. 


But their food service.... crappy both times Ive been there. 

The last time I was there I walked in, hadn't been greeted by anyone at the empty front podium, and just found a table. I figured once I sat down Id wait for an employee to get back to the menus and go up and ask for one. So I saw a lady working up at the front and went up and asked her.  She said that they stopped serving food at...... I cant remember if it was 9 or 10 pm.... but she gave me a certain time that the kitchen closed. I went back to my table and looked at the time. It was 10 minutes before the time she told me the kitchen closed. I thought that was kinda dumb, but oh well.... maybe they stopped taking orders 10 minutes ahead or something. The next thing I see the SAME EXACT LADY seat four people RIGHT NEXT to our table and give them menus. Then she takes their order, and brings out their food. All I wanted were some freakin french fries and I had to sit there and watch the people who got there long after me eating french fries instead. RUDE!","2009-08-05 04:46:06"

"jOpJBXl6goiRYvsS8Oeriw",5,"Would it be weird if I wanted to move in and permanently live here!? The style of this salon is impeccable. The color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you're in a Restoration Hardware magazine...in France...surrounded by heirloom antiques. I didn't know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn't know I needed in my life until I arrived. 
Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up, that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety. I don't know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now I want them for my own collection. 

I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I'm loving both! 
So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I've gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end, but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on. 
CURED was not only high end, but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning. 

I didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there's a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I'm assuming once those are complete, parking will be pretty straight forward? 

When my Mom & Sister come into town next I'm going to take them here & go to Local Honey for lunch since it's so close.

"5zWhnq05f3r6ntTqHUF5LA",4,"4-5 stars, this is just after one visit so far, worth a try if you're a thai fan. I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see ""how they do things"" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.

I did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn't be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn't need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.

We started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I've had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don't have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. 

We then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it's too hot for me, I don't taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn't be overcooked, and they weren't. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?

We then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).

Like Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. 

My dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.

I did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. 

I didn't get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn't think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.","2013-06-24 09:58:07"

Chickie's and Pete's is a friendly sports bar, particularly for women, and it has lots of seating for Sunday games. I appreciate the sound booth in the sky, as it means that (admittedly bad) music is played during the commercials, along with special themes for Eagles fans. And, the place seems to be smoke free.

But, I am not impressed by the famous crab fries, which are crinkled, lightly fried, and seasoned with garlic, chili pepper, and salt. Something about the congealed cheese sauce detracts from the entire experience, and I also prefer my fries to be piping hot. However, there are towers of beer available (complete with taps), which is pleasantly tacky.

"0-8YJMqAill6hdhjlQfkbA",2,"A quasi political rant and a store review all wrapped in one, so enjoy. 

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, ""Who even goes to Kmart anymore?"" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's ""Whitewashed.""  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

"_UJt6A57MmdanQoYr4dx2A",3,"Despite it's great reviews by other Yelpers, I was not that blown away by Nippon Tei. 

My roommate and I were craving sushi and were recommended to come here by Yelp and a friend so we decided to give it a shot. 

First off, they get bonus points for serving FREE edemame as an appetizer. I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. 

On to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. 

The other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. 

I am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites. The prices were average compared to other sushi bars, so that won't really help them out either when it comes to bringing me back. We will see!","2010-08-22 04:33:06"
"0gFENhAB6mfMwL1V0Z2fWw",1,"Went to see Star Wars Rogue One yesterday in 3D.  Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a ""closed-system"" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.  I've seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1.","2016-12-19 16:42:59"

When one of the servers came over to check on the $23 pork chop (which was not listed in the menu - $18 price was), my spouse commented there was a lot of fat....she seemed baffled by his comment, then walked away! The ""ropa vieja"" dish was good, but overpriced for being served in moderate portion.

We ate from the Sunday brunch menu--only decent value on the menu is the chicken strips and fries.  My wife ordered the seasonal salad, which was comically small and was way short on the actual lettuce (and not cheap either).  Chicken was good, but nothing better than Raising Canes in my opinion.

I told her an employee. She asked my title. I told her. She gives me a total and I asked her about the discount. She says it's only for front desk. I'm shocked that this is a departmental thing 1 and 2 I'm thinking to myself, ""I'm in sales. I get groups of people here. They ALWAYS asked for recommendations."" I said well should I hang up and have front desk place my order? She huffed and puffed and then said ""well i'll give it to you this time but please dont abuse it."" I was so shocked at how rude she was. So when I finally got my food, I tipped the driver and gave him their menus back and said we will no longer be doing business with you guys.

I like how you can wander about and watch the game from the lower levels, and that despite it's a sold out game, it never feels cramped or you're really aching to get around the stadium.

"pPKI8l5FuX3aOHCQAlsfsg",4,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch yesterday, and I am so glad we did. I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!","2015-06-08 18:10:38"

I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home. I think its just one of those places I am glad to say I've been to, but I don't think I will choose to go there again.","2012-08-14 23:47:30"
"XT_3UpEhO5eJIFxevnv_Yw",4,"Service is excellent. Atmosphere is great. The raw bar was fantastic. Those were the best Alaskan crab legs I've had. Well worth splurging for them. 

My friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.

Unfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as ""heaven in his mouth"", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.

But everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.

The only downside is that its street parking only, which isn't something that they can control.

We went in one night about an hour or so before closing just to find that they were only serving a partial menu - we're not talking that late, it was like, 9:30 on a weekend.  There was no mention of going down to a bar menu on the website so I was a bit annoyed by that.  Something about 'surprise disappointments that could be totally avoided' really bother me.  So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?  I told him I'm sure removing a single topping wouldn't cause the kitchen staff any issues...  The rest of the meal we were generally ignored and the service wasn't great.  I found the food to be overpriced for the quality.  Unless there is a special reason to attend, I don't think we'll be going back.","2015-08-30 14:15:43"
"MA5iblOZ4FWIQ_B3UBKKMA",4,"Second visit even better than the first!!  Loved the butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons, and the delightfully filling mushroom yakisoba. Amazing flavor, and a smoky , meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl. 
My only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus, food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain, just barely, but with really happy tummies.","2017-01-27 21:37:20"
"5s2dsOLWfGEbk8LztH3uNQ",3,"I cannot comment on the food as I had only a couple beers. I did have the white IPA and a red ale which were good but not blow me away. I might be spoiled having 2 friends who brew professionally but the beers were good, not outstanding. The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars. It does say something that there was a loyal following at 4pm on a Sunday.","2014-04-01 05:30:09"
"TunQqLbhPJDpncASCgkxmA",2,"I first found out about this adorable little salon here on yelp while looking for a place to get a manicure downtown/ CBD.  I visited on 3/8/13 and got their ""Mini Manicure""- it's only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3/18/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I'm not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.

I was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.

I'm conflicted, but I don't know that I'll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn't gel- because I can't even take the polish off myself.  So I'm forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it's Monday afternoon....","2013-03-18 20:32:27"
"DhA2QaUSdz2m9GirtOrzJA",4,"A bit off the beaten path for most tourists, as it is in the Marigny, but worth the trip. Sure, the place is not perfect, but there are ultra-expensive restaurants in the FQ that are also not perfect. Look, cheap food, especially food this good, gives ""wiggle"" room for imperfections.

Breakfast served all day is a bonus. Sometimes you just got to have a lox omelet (under $10) late in the day. The restaurant boasts vegetarian and *gasp* vegan dishes, but someone needs to tell them that cheese doesn't fit into either of those categories. That aside, the french fry poboy, and the mac 'n cheese sandwiches are amazing. So is the Saturday Blue Plate of BBQ Chicken legs. 

Every entree is under $10, well except for the Friday Blue Plate, but why quibble? And who can argue with $5 Bloody Mary's, especially ones that are this good?","2008-12-05 04:04:50"

"uzcuenhBRkoqAdQsmFV7mg",2,"I've been driving by this location for several weeks anticipating their opening.  With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.

They took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.

Video games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.

More TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).

A word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.

Typically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.

The food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. 

Those staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.

We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something.

To touch on some other reviews... i understand everyone has a different experience, but to say the place is 'too hipster' seems like someones still jaded from feeling left out in high school...  and personally attacking the owner is tasteless and has no place in a review.  We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives.

"u4as3T1vLQSX1KFssFDiOg",4,"Stopped here last week while in the area from Burbank. Had read about it on Trip Advisor. It is in a great location, quiet, peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees. For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. 
Based on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.
For the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.

"TtVxGfc-KMnwWkxGCDXlsw",5,"I brought my boyfriend here on a Saturday for a tour and beer sampling since Yuengling is one of his favorite beers. We never knew it was so close!

Be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the FAQ's. 
- First note: There were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs. the insisted closed toe shoe policy, but that could be because of the next note.
- Second note: There is no production/brewing on Saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty.

We looked around the main waiting/lobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin.  We had quite a large group, which had to split into two smaller ones. The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!

Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore. The BEST PART? FREE. Tips are encouraged! ;)
We tried the Premium Lager, Lager, and Black and Tan. Sadly they were out of the Lord Chesterfield this day and the Premium Light is not available here in FL.

To sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.

I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.

I ordered the regular cheeseburger with a ton of toppings and a regular size french fry to share with my boyfriend. The burgers were delicious. The bread was soft and tasty and the burgers were succulent and juicy. The fries were disappointing. McDonalds fries taste better and usually aren't even as cold as Jake's were.

"EbtqfxRiY6nUmSQA-pIPMQ",1,"As a frequent customer who has come since the place opened, I had previously rated this place higher, based on a recent experience decided to downgrade.

Myself and both in-laws had visited, one of which was senior. Had a mail coupon for $5 off, which had no disclaimer.  I wanted to apply this to our party of three (2 adults, 1 senior). Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law, applied the coupon. Then told my father in law, the senior, to pay on his own. Seriously, Retarded.

The woman who assisted me was not really friendly (sorry I didn't get names at either visit) but was helpful and professional. My second visit I was assisted by a different woman who was also helpful, knowledgeable and professional. I realized the women were not being rude; they are just quiet. Neither woman made small talk but answered every question I had. 
Now my second visit deserved 5 stars. I normally pack things myself and just need it shipped, but I was shipping a skateboard and could not box it correctly. The woman went above and beyond to help me and she offered more assistance than was professionally required.  I will return to this location for all my shipping needs.
The store is clean, and packs (no pun intended) a lot of product into a small space. The staff is knowledgeable. They have boxes, packing materials, and offer copying services.

Defeated, I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order.

The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there, no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left. 

The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread.

After finding street parking near the mattress store, we plopped down and ordered the 3-taco plate (al pastor, mmmm) with beans and rice on the side and a burrito (barbocoa). I am a creature of habit and order the same tacos, but the bf has ventured out to get other dishes such as the fajita plate or the really spicy shrimp (camarones del diablo?). All very tasty.

We ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we'd individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others' food. 
I ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes. 
The wait for the check and processing payment was long and arduous, a problem again because we had a Lyft driver waiting outside for us.

"kLgcYk9TxIjLe6y6eChetg",1,"Unfortunately, I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.","2018-02-11 04:01:35"
"5Ord-c6rkWrbWWz39i6J5g",5,"I am so glad we had our wedding here!!! I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! 

We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.

The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.

What I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. 

The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.

Five stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.","2015-12-20 21:47:02"

"PlYifdeyiixRZkymbUNqVQ",5,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking. One Wawa store is pretty much the same as another, so why even bother writing a review? But I think we have a winner here.

When this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!

Secondly, I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.

As for service, they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark.

*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.
*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again
*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again 
The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated.

"Dkv4YJVG3vOg12i3GJxc-g",4,"Chef Kevin Sbraga knows fried chicken. My first exposure to his succulent birds was the hot chicken at The Fat Ham. Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer. My friend Chris W got the filet mignon and butter poached king crab surf and turf. For dessert, I had a slice of salted pecan pie and he had the ice cream sundae.

The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better. 

We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone. 

The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.

Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.

On the upside, they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).

Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.

"MCsvM0AX9l-UG641iQKacA",5,"Amazing food!! and  the whole experience is great there every time. I suggest going there with a  group of about 6 people so it doesn't totally break the bank but if you've got the money then who cares! Have fun!

First you enter in and select the wine you would like. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their stock. (And if for some reason at the end you didn't  finish your bottle they will cork it back up for you to take.) Then select your cheese platter. Lots of yummy stinky cheese to select  from and prosciutto. I wish they had more cured meats but it's all yummy anyway. You pay for the wine and cheese there. Which in a large group one or two people can take care of this  part. 

Then going to get a seat can be difficult but just be patient. There's outdoor seating that's very nice and always a live band playing. Inside upstairs is nice as well. Once you're all set with your wine and group it's time to order. Go to the window and play your order. Definite things you must get.... the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and the goat cheese and mushroom dish....AMAZING! Although everything I've ever had here is great. 

Then just wait for your cheese platter, food and enjoy!","2015-03-18 18:00:12"

This is the only paint store I have ever been to besides places like Home Depot or Lowes...so as far as a paint places goes it ranks high on my list. Not only do they sale paint but also everything that you need to get the job done. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. They keep your paint information on file so you don't have to remember it if you need to purchase more. I normally go when there is a sale on paint...keep an eye out for 30% off....we buy interior Super Paint which was a part of the deal.","2015-05-26 13:46:09"

"4zpACJ-dd3A_rxv-qo62LA",3,"I find it hugely ironic that WF is trying to reposition itself as a 'value' food store right now when others (i.e. Trader Joe's up the street) have been doing that for years.  For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.

Despite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.

Plus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.","2008-08-18 21:11:53"

"mx_r8EYx8JooAHa63maSBg",3,"Monthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from Fresh and had it delivered. 

My selection was the Chopped Italian salad. The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!

I do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches.","2013-07-12 20:30:23"

They have lots of fantastic pizzas, but my favorites are the California (white pizza with pieces of breaded chicken cutlet, bacon, and tomatos, and ranch dressing instead of red sauce), Meatlovers (5 meats, but the sausage is the kind that does not have fennel in it, so more points for that), Veggie pizza (they saute the veggies first before they go on the pizza, and instead of using green peppers, they use sweet peppers).  

Unfortunately, the shop was damaged by a fire in the next door laundry mat and they've been closed for a few weeks, but I can't wait for their doors to open again soon.

Light beers dont have to equal tasteless. My boyfriend had a ""hoppy beer with citrus undertones"". He could taste neither the hops or the citrus  (disclaimer - we are from VT and are used to very hoppy beers!)  

Now the food - that was great. We went at lunch time and was able to get a soup and salad for 8.95. We both had the same thing - Chicken Bruchetta salad and French Onion Soup. The portion was fantastic for a lunch size and the soup really flavorful!

The pita bread was burned- not just over toasted, but black on the majority of the wedges.  I went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it. 

The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would ""upgrade her hummus for no charge, because normally it's $1.00"" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says, ""please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.""  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil, er I mean hummus.

"fQfAfRvLDSUrnDoh0ByBKA",4,"First impression:

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?","2011-08-25 01:22:34"
"XiAI47_GWuqV0cxwuYB3Bw",4,"Went here with a few friends as the place to have our reunion dinner. We hadn't seen eachother since elementary school and got reacquainted through Facebook so this was a pretty special dinner. 

The restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this. I do think the food was worth the price although all of my party thought it was very expensive. I ordered the lobster bake which was delicious. It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly. 

My friends ordered the fritters, carpaccio, crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila, a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it. 

And I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately, I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive, nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday. He was just real cool. 

5 stars for service
3 stars for food
4 stars for ambience 
2 stars for price.  

But I was satisfied.","2018-05-28 20:37:32"
"Ly4PZdIlbIhLZO6WdDAaPg",3,"My first trip to Susanna Foo was at 6 months old when the restaurant was still a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint owned by Susanna's parents. My parents have been taking my brother and I ever since. I have many fond memories of Susanna fashioning dolls for us out of the linen napkins and preparing Chicken with Cashew Nuts when we refused to eat anything else. The food has always been reliable, but now that I am an adult, I find it lacking excitement. The service is always impeccable and I have never been disappointed by the overall decor or ambience. I'd like to see Susanna improve upon some of her traditional recipes by either adding new flavors or perhaps returning to her Chinese roots with a more ethnic menu. I'm hoping there will be a revitalization and that I will come to love Susanna Foo as much as I did as a child.","2008-12-03 04:24:16"

Spiro's jumped out at me, not because of the size of their advertisement (small) but Greek food just sounded good to me tonight.  I wasn't disappointed at all.

Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must.

but 3.5 could've been 4 if it wasn't so expensive for what i'm getting. and if the kitchen was more accommodating.

the first time i ever ate there, (around when it first opened), i ordered ravioli and received 3 or 5 pieces for $11-13.  another time i visited, i tried substituting a salad for fries with my burger. and my server said, ""no, sorry, the kitchen won't do that."" 

are you $^%ER@# kidding me??? it wasn't a super modification. it's not as if i asked for a burger with only one bun, no tomato, half piece of lettuce, two onion rings, and love. it wasn't like i wanted to substitute lobster for fries!!! needless to say, this is the first time i've been unable to substitute. i'm usually really easy to please, but this is the first time i've ever felt difficult. at least in my head. is this in my head?

Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders. 

We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it ""was good.""  The prices for drinks weren't that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers). 

We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter. 

All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. ""no beans"" ""light on the cheese"") were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience. 

What a way to wrap up a review..

When we asked for our table, both hostesses looking at their paper, then said they'd have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later, they returned and did not acknowledge us. Meanwhile, another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. We then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn't want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. So unprofessional.
We walked up again, after they continued to ignore us, and asked about our table. They weren't apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. They continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. We got a smug ""I'm sorry, but she was new"" and they brushed us off.
I really understand that sometimes things just don't go the way they were supposed to and that people make mistakes. However, a little customer service would have gone a long way. Offer us some water, or a seat at the bar or say that you're doing everything you can to get us in as soon as possible. They basically blew us off and blamed it on the new girl.

Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. 

On to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).

The dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit.

The rooms have the essentials. The beds are quite comfortable.
The cafe isn't bad although it is a little foggy as to what comes with the room. Apparently its one entree and one beverage. Not a bad deal.

Cons
Hallways are a bit shaggy. NBD since I am not staying in the hallway.
Room cleaning dropped the ball on my last stay. The room was clean, but I found a bag from BK in my mini fridge ... eeeew!","2013-02-22 03:04:20"
"AbSXiVHrNquCbR1JvIy0ew",2,"I recently moved in a few blocks away from Henry's and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house. So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it. 

1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness. 

2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association. 

3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter. The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.

I'm coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn Henry :((( not a great first impression.","2016-08-25 15:00:59"
"_pYWxZrAWBSaF0_OXIS20w",5,"We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.

   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.

  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?

In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! 

The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!

On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.

At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki.","2014-08-24 23:19:52"
"77AdIZqrL9rUHkCOrONhUA",3,"Let me start by saying buying a car is an intimidating process. I feel like I am playing poker with someone who can see all of the cards while I can only see my cards. I felt well prepared and needed to use all of my preparation to get what I considered to be a fair deal (time will tell whether I really got a fair deal) on a used (pre-owned is what they like to say) car. Do your homework (KBB.com, Edmunds.com etc) As long as the car performs like I expect it to over time, I will be happy. Sam Ladd was the salesman who always treated me courteously and let me drive lots of cars while I was deciding what vehicle I wanted. I drove everything from subcompacts to full sized SUVs. I visited many dealerships I chose Toyota of Santa Barbara because they ultimately had the vehicle that I wanted. I bought what I believe will meet my families needs.

"gWU2Yko2aFH00jcFVYsquA",3,"3 separate reviews:

CITY TOUR: 1 STAR -Not worth the time or money. We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. 

The only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.

PLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) 

SWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.  The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel.

"bg3TAimbMppppLUTfN46nA",1,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS
By far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. 

I never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison.

"S31KpJsHYnBX9Qv5qG1LJA",1,"Never been to this location before, never had a problem with any other location. It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked.

Entramos y nos pareció muy ameno, limpio y confortable para comer ahí. Nos atendió un hombre muy amable y atento.
Pedimos los siguientes sabores:
- prosciutto (jamón crudo);
- ham (jamón cocido);
- pepperoni;
- cebolla;
- hongos;
- anchoas y
- albahaca y tomate.

Las pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra, con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal.
Si bien este comentario parece limitarse únicamente a una estricta relación precio-calidad, no menos verdad es que, en mi opinión, la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflejó cómo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ahí mismo.

"pIyQ9YmxoQ-UrIs-ANTi8Q",4,"Dearest Reader,

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to ""make me something awesome with whiskey in it."" ""What kind of drink do you want?,"" he inquired. ""I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these."" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the ""The Commodore"" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,

"hG9RTxxivb0ZXzEk4JXTXA",1,"I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.

It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  

I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.

My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?

I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.

The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.

After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.","2010-03-13 22:33:10"

They also gave me two free cookies with my order and I have to say they were SO good.

"ulk36r__RoJhfyDVTexo_A",5,"If you are in a hurry and don't have time to read my entire review, here's the bottom line:  this place is FANTASTIC!

After my 3 month old car got rear ended TWICE inside of TWO weeks at the end of October, I took my dealership's recommendation and ended up bringing it in to Prestigious for repairs.  I am really glad I chose them.

First off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don't mind the typical ""shop"" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.

Next off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.

Juan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.

I got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people's standards.

It sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.","2013-12-06 23:51:40"

They have an uncrowded floor of tables and booths and a lunch counter along one side.  The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.

I ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.

The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. 

The coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! 

Our bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again, I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's.","2014-01-17 03:06:58"
"GnloZSSEp60TE6YcR_cszg",5,"If you are visiting Indianapolis, I highly suggest this hotel. My boyfriend and I went just for one night and used his AAA discount which saved us a lot. They have a parking structure attached to the hotel for $20 a night. Starting at the garage they had such cool urban art that continue throughout our stay. The check in was an easy process and the service was amazing. Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.

We checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. 

Overall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to Indianapolis, especially if you are going to a Pacers or Colts game, is was fantastic. Next time I go back to Indianapolis I will be staying here again.","2014-02-05 18:17:45"
"yRJkUOmrNhpOOn0-FgnqCQ",1,"Cashier was trying to put a beer on my to go order and I did not get the fish taco I ordered.

They have nice setting and the establishment seems to be fairly nice, it has got tvs, a bar, a number of tables in various sizes, and a downtown street patio complete with fire heaters for cold nights.

I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.

Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.  They were starting to run out of the beef and dog that I ordered when I got in at the end of a fairly short line, i would hate to think how much worst if I came in a bit later for the dinner rush.","2016-12-04 02:31:22"
"PcB61RR_VL8Bf5uNFM54Pg",3,"When I was preparing to write this review and give Sam's a particular number of stars, I encountered a dilemma.  Should my star rating be based upon comparing Sam's to all Sports Bars in which I have ever been?  Or, should it be a comparison to Nashville Sports Bars?

I chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.

Sam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  

The service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.

The food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.

But, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.  All and all, if you want to watch sports at a bar, then I would recommend Sam's.","2011-01-09 03:26:00"

I recommend making an appointment! This is not a dime a dozen nail salon! They offer the newest designs and jewels that so many others don't, and because of that, it's busy.

"U-Y5nGkhbVsTWCEGqLibZA",4,"As a childless woman I wasn't sure how I was going to enjoy my experience here but I give the good folks at Chuck E Cheese credit....they do run a fairly tight ship. There are lots of staff running around both on the floors and behind the counters so whether you need to order another sample platter or get a refund after a machine ate your token you will never be stuck waiting too long. There is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they don't wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know.

I like that all the games here are just one token. There are also quite a few different types of games available from Arcade style to games of chance. One thing I did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddo's are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion.

There was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over. I did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table. 

The staff here were great and very attentive making sure all the special birthday rock stars were well looked after. I don't know how many times I would really need to come into a place like this as I don't have that many friends with kids but it was great to see them enjoying themselves as well as reliving some fond memories from my own trips to Chuck E Cheese as a little girl.","2013-12-07 20:41:00"

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. 

I used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.

His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here.

I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. 

She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part, and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just ""drinking up all the lotion."" Yes, I realize it's dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. 

When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! 

Overall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon.

I always get a veggie burrito and load it up with lots of veggies! I also like their chips and ""medium"" salsa. If ever around Delgado, check out Taco del Mar!","2014-04-20 01:11:54"

"1Ejkx1stGB11yYfU17UQCA",5,"My wife and I had been wanting to go here but just hadn't made it a priority.  

I had the fish and chips.  The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.

My wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.

If you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.","2016-05-31 13:45:57"

Sad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!

The patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum
a homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.","2015-09-24 22:16:52"

We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).

Spasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.

They start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.

I started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.

Spasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!","2018-04-27 20:08:54"

"srw8FcuizFYyHRWnLsYVOQ",3,"Have only been once a couple of months ago, so maybe this was a one-off experience...Ordered a piece of carrot cake, which tasted fine. Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the ""fanciness"" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). 

My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.

I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.

"NElfLcKdeTwS86PTPEkWjw",2,"I heard a number of good things about this place ,but I was very disappointed. Parking is terrible which isn't a huge deal but be prepared to spend a few minutes looking for a parking spot. We ordered 5 tacos total and it took about 30 minutes to get them. It seemed a little ridiculous for a few tacos, plus they weren't even hot. Slightly warm at best. Taste was ok, but wasn't anything special at all. Buffalo chicken wasn't great, the  Bbq and Korean were decent and the shrimp was mediocre. Overall, I gave it a shot and it wasn't worth the wait and effort parking so I don't see us going back.","2016-01-30 04:38:48"
"oyPscvzbdr9Cs2Q4fJlPCw",2,"The gym part of City Fitness is better than most, good equipment, clean, variety, it's a nice gym. I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.

MBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't ""personal"" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.

If you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.","2014-01-17 17:38:39"
"cp12LEo_c7SNbpscnbYjfA",3,"Four stars for price. 
I drive truck, so I've eaten bbq all over America. This place is better than most, but it's certainly not 4 star worthy. I'd say the food is more like 2.5 star. 
The cheeseburger was quite large and the meat was tasty. (Be advised: if you don't stop them they'll automatically put that disgusting invention called mayonnaise on it.) I got it plain so I can't comment on their lettuce/tomato game. 
The pork bbq sammich was soggy on the bottom. Moist is good, but this was just plain wet. The meat itself was bland but not bad. 
The bbq sauce is pretty good but not great. 
The Mac & Cheese tasted ok but the noodles were way overcooked. It'd be much better if it were baked and had a little crustiness to it.

"kyjaqazHasxVAweZG2xxPw",2,"So we've been wanting to try the sushiritos since they opened up a location closer to us and we finally tried it last Friday. 

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. 

Overall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal. With this location being essentially at a revolving door of new customers on the corner of Penn's campus, I think they have the potential to do well. But I don't think I'll be coming back. We'll take our $34 elsewhere.","2015-03-05 01:59:10"

"lm7Q8pH26kqx1gbjCJ16ZQ",5,"This hotel is a gem in the heart of Philadelphia.

It's a cozy, quaint, and charming property. The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. 
The decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. 

Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. 

Coffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say ""good morning"" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.

I've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...

A few things to note:
Its location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. 

There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)

Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!

Overall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.","2016-02-23 21:31:39"

"xnA_bGa4zJ7fLUPTOCT0-A",4,"One of my most favorite Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy but absolutely delicious meals.

Never an issue being seated promptly. A casual dining experience awaits. Service is pleasant. Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.

Now onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:
Naan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat.","2011-04-22 02:02:10"

"2fA_8TK24PULHnFz4CE_JA",2,"To the other reviewers 
You are reviewing the god damn stadium, not that your a Philly fan, and OMG your team won the world series in 08. 

-The food sucks, they do not have enough vendors, So if your enjoying the game, you pretty much have to get up to buy yourself a pretzel or soda. 
-Point out the worst food, the ""Hoagies"" or whatever are Terrible. Aren't they suppose to be like really good (Believe I'm in Philly). The french fries are mad greasy and no crunch or anything. They were soggy, greasy fries!!!! 
- They have cheap small TVs, that are blurry as hell, so there goes the idea of watching the game while your on line waiting for your food. 
- I would love to understand how the game has just started (3rd inning), and I find empty beer containers everywhere.. 

This is not part of my judgement, but for other people to be aware and be careful 
Philly fans are the RUDEST and NASTIEST people. They are very drunk people, they get in your face, they will spill things on you. Even if your a girl, they have no respect. 

This stadium SUCKS, visit it, knock it off your list, see cheap home runs, since the stadium is built for hitters... 
but we advised...Bring your own food and beware of Philly fans. 
PS: There still are nasty even if you aren't a mets fan...they are just rude people.","2009-05-19 19:12:28"

"M7AGmOpm0PzSdSmP8dA_3A",5,"This place is absolutely amazing. A cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive. I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!

I got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.

Thoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! 

The upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.

Definitely go to this place! I was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip. (They use an iPad to ring you up). The service/help was so great and I would have left a tip but I had no cash. Any ways, highly recommend this place for desserts!!","2016-01-17 06:11:00"

Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.

It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter.

"X-o--dwf0HuFMittYi4wCA",1,"oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. 

friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. 

hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. 

our server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  

At the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. 

perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.","2013-09-04 03:14:34"

"HcYulXMN_jgausdUXNhBSA",5,"After hearing about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite, my SO and I decided to try this place! We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! 

For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.

For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.

Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.

Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.","2018-02-24 19:10:30"

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   

I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.

My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.

Then I had pork schnitzel and ""pommes frites"" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it ""Southern"".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.

I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.

A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.

"Mb5k1Gllt2_x8l_0WM3lUg",4,"My dad and I were here for lunch and after reading some of the reviews, I was excited to check out this restaurant located where an O'Henry's once stood.

The place was fairly empty at 1 on a Friday and we were lead upstairs. Honestly, there's not much going on up there and it was a bit warm, but we decided to stick it out. Everything on the menu looked great and I decided to get the Catfish Acadian, which is catfish topped with crawfish and sauce with a side of vegetables. My dad got the pork chop.

My dish was great! I have no idea what was in the sauce but it was delicious and it was a perfect pairing with the fish. The vegetables were also really good; they were nicely cooked and fresh. My dad wasn't overly blown away by his pork chop, so if you find yourself here you might want to stick to the seafood.

Bria was our waitress and she was wonderful! She was attentive, kept the fresh iced tea coming and she was extremely personable. She was probably the highlight of the visit.

I'm not sure if I would go back. The food was good, but the atmosphere left something to be desired and I feel like I can get good catfish at plenty of places without going out of my way.

"gYKwhONeiszsrzi7dhT2pg",2,"Well, well.... Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.

Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.

We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece ""jumbo"" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says ""here's your food."" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.
***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.
I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.
We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.
I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.

I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone ""youguysdoingalright?okaycool."" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.

Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!

2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.
1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.","2014-03-15 18:07:44"

Food is good and reasonably  priced. We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner.

"ub2BMOwKSTbhbuovib8Gtw",4,"I feel so comfortable with the Mazzoni Center.  I, and many others, am incredibly lucky and grateful that these services exist.  Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you're assumed to be a certain way.  Here, there are no assumptions.  They know who they're working with, and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information.  If you're in need of gynecology and you're not a woman, for example, they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity.

My biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists.  I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room.  I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger, more private space.

If you visit during youth drop-in hours rather than making an appointment, you will probably wait a very long time to see someone.  This is completely understandable, in my opinion.  They'll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call.

Occasionally, I've noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait.  This is not a common issue, and I find that, overall, I receive more attentive service here than at any other clinic I've visited.

Be aware that the doctor you want to speak with may not always be available over the phone.  Don't be afraid to leave messages with reception.  You'll always receive quick assistance.","2016-12-19 07:32:05"

"o6MVysCp6JGQy4ujbBki8g",5,"Yes, there are vegan options in University City, you just have to know where to look for them. MexiCali has a number of great options.

Many options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. 

I end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back. There's often a line at the restaurant, but this place has been around for years and they have a great system to get you your burrito in a very timely manner.","2012-10-08 16:04:22"

Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash purée and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish.

They were veal and beef meatballs that melted in your mouth. Our other appetizer was some sort of grilled cheese that was amazing as well. For our entree we had the fishermen stew that was full of flavor and well balanced. Initially I did not think I was going to like it but it was to die for. Every element of the stew had it's own flavor and it was properly cooked. My girlfriend ordered the steak that came with cauliflower puree and a vegetable medley that was delicious as well.

The steak was so juicy, tender and seasoned so eloquently and the puree was seasoned beautifully as well.

As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the ""knuckle sandwich"", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's ""Knuckle Sandwich"" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning.

"EuwyOJyYTEDfDt3raOWMUA",4,"I've only eaten here twice and my experience has been great overall. The first time I went, they had just opened. There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.

The seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's ""trifecta"" or boiling crab's, ""the whole shabang"" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.

Lastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common.

"7h2yLn1XxNd9cSQq6lkUzg",5,"I moved to Philadelphia from the midwest as a wide eyed 19 year old full of wonder. Yuengling lager was the first beer I've ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time. Smooth, sweet, cheap, it's like me in a bottle. I love that the bottlecaps can be rusty, I like that the taste varies per batch, I even like its relatively low alcohol content. 

The tour was pretty great, the British tour woman was funny in a non canned way. She took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat (signed, sports, I haven't a clue). I was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment, I could've spit in the mash and no one would've been the wiser. The whole facility reminded me of St. Pete Catholic High, 50's cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls. 

The tasting, that's what you came for right? Fantastic. They were out of Lord Chesterfield, but who drinks that? I ""tasted"" the shit out of the lager, probably 6 times. It makes sense, the bar is next to the gift shop and I went a bit insane in there. 

The fact that Dick Yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star. This is a family business, one that deserves support as Inbev has encroached upon everything else.","2011-08-26 03:27:14"

It's old-school brewpub with lots of games for children.  The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  
The food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit.","2018-08-05 02:17:13"
"AyZIiDWJFuJnLve6wG9Exw",4,"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering.","2016-04-12 16:56:09"
"abH_AUx1cylLv7cj3CyyGQ",5,"Having stayed here several times, it is my favorite hotel. The staff is excellent. Really exceptional. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets.

Rooms are clean, heating and AC are quiet, beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.

Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?

Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.

The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time. 

This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.

They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.

Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.

I really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that.
Yup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us. 
I would never stay here again, and I would urge you to think twice about it. Without seeing every carpet and mattress in the place replaced, there's no way I'd trust that the bugs were gone.","2011-02-14 16:25:09"

Both times I've been here, my side order of rice has been hard and dry, and burritos sad and limp. Additionally, the waitress we've had the two times going there had a horrible attitude. The only thing that saves this place is the guac, and the strong margaritas.

He told us the history of the restaurant and gave us some good suggestions. The food was some of the best Italian food I have had in a long time. You can tell everything is made fresh.  The bread was delicious and a new recipe the owner received from his brother who lives in Sicily. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped Shrimp with a yummy sauce. I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and my boyfriend ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce in both dishes was excellent! The portions were a decent size with plenty of leftovers for my lunch the next day.  Finally, the cannoli was the best I have ever had! My boyfriend has been to Italy and said it was just as awesome as the ones he tasted there. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal for a good price.

She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill, I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner.

So we waited a bit and went down to The Praline Connection. Dad was in heaven. He's been talking about the food since we left. Dad got the taste of soul platter pictured below. He said the fried chicken was the best he's had and he had not tasted red beans and rice like that since he was a kid and my granny used to make em. Mom got the meatloaf with cabbage and lima beans. I got the ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. My ribs were good but hard to cut the meat off the bone. I could've ate em with my hands but I didn't want a BBQ face. The potato salad was good but my mac & cheese was a little bland. The cornbread was great.  I'm going back next time for the fried chicken!","2015-01-04 03:39:09"
"Ac6kBYiSpqZMFoQW6jT8XA",4,"Buddy Brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in Tampa. Their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice. I really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top. The store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in New York. 

This particular location is in Hyde Park Village. The benefit is that parking is free. The down side is that seating is limited. The store is also extremely cold, so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long. You may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around Hyde Park Village instead.","2018-08-04 23:43:07"
"4qFaquOa0m60HWq27tHayw",5,"A really nice place to get your hair did with as much of an edge as you want.  

In the East Loop, across from the Pageant, might be one of the most underrated salons in the city.  I first went into this place as a walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, I'm a guy, and since my hair is pretty coarse, grows weird, and I want a bit of style to it, I go to hair salons.  At V Vegaz I've never been dissatisfied with my cut. 

When you walk in you realize how spacious the place is, with a bit of a slightly modern, slightly baroque interior design.  There's a nice vibe there too amongst the employees, and you can see that the stylists are happy with the work situation.  Of course, happy stylists, to me, mean better haircuts.

I go to Callie, since that first walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, she's real friendly, which is a nice touch, but she's also a great stylist.  I'm a bit wishy washy when I look for a cut, usually changing what I want most of the time.  Callie's sensitive to that, and really understands how my hair grows and where it's going to move.   I think the biggest compliment to her is that, as I'm a once a month haircut kinda guy, my brother and sister told me they really my hair a full month after I had it cut with Callie.  So that's really a testament to her skills.

I've not gotten color there, but it is a full service salon, and not just a turn and burn place.  

I highly recommend this place.","2007-12-14 23:37:38"

I also needed it to be done fast - I was leaving the country the next day. Not only did she do all of these alterations in a day, they were also excellently done - neat and professional - and now I have a beautiful suit that fits me brilliantly for my business trip!

We were walking around trying to find somewhere else to go, noticed this unmarked bar and decided to check it out. We were so excited to see that there were so many great beers on tap, and there was a decent crowd there so we stuck around. It was a fun night! And after a few weeks of wondering where we had gone, we were able to find the Irish Pol on Yelp :D

I went back for happy hour recently and it wasn't exactly as I had remembered. It was pretty dark and dingy looking inside,  and the few people there were much much older. It just had a weird vibe. The beer was still great of course. The happy hour special was $3 drafts, but most of the beers I wanted weren't included.

"kJRseW0applr3PAKd6Q5eA",3,"Stayed here for a bachelorette party. This place got the job done. Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ /night.  This ain't Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. 

Pros: 
-decently priced
-clean and cozy rooms
-charming exterior and grounds
-relatively comfortable beds
-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc
-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room

Cons:
-dated decor 
-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn't really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. 
- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique
-no hair dryer, so bring your own
-no complimentary breakfast
-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.

Overall, I still don't think I would've chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range.","2017-05-26 06:13:56"

1) Super friendly and knowledgeable staff 
2) Roomy, with lots of outlets and enough space to accommodate mid-sized groups (like the recent Yelp Office Hours)
3) Delicious tea, of course!

I've always loved their ""Awake"" Fizz Tea, but I've also broadened my horizons to include Pearl Tea (aka bubble tea). The taro flavor rocked my socks off. It did take a little getting used to though, as I had a mini anxiety attack every time I took a sip. Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering ""is there one in my straw?"" It's totally worth the suspense, though.

The only thing that still troubles me is the music. It's just...not right. In fact, sometimes it's pretty distracting. It's easily avoided, however; just bring headphones and your own musical selection and all is well.","2008-12-05 20:36:16"

You are instructed to order at the counter....except ocassionally, for certain clients, they'll actually come to your table and take your order ...but it seems pretty random.  It's all self serve (shitty) coffee and bottled beverages.

Lobster consommé was delicious and filet was PERFECTLY cooked & seasoned, melted in my mouth, and a generous portion. And that view is just stunning!

Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.  The roast pork highlighted the dish - fork tender, caramelized and left me wanting more.","2014-12-17 20:19:45"

When I showed up with my friends, they didn't have my name on the list and forgot that they even offered me a happy hour. It was irritating, and after some fighting, they eventually let me through.

There is a dress code (no sneakers, flip flops, hats, etc.), but I don't really mind. The bouncers and bartenders aren't very friendly and can be slow, and I never tried the food. The crowd isn't great either - attractive and douchey (maybe because, like us, they're just trying to get drunk and go somewhere else).

"Sr2dMnhk4AqZhvo1Hbvisw",1,"I don't know this for sure, but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...

I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. 

First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. 

In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. 

I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, ""24.99.""

I respond, ""That's not right.""

He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.

At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.

THAT'S the unscrupulous part.

CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.","2010-08-20 20:22:30"

He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.

So it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy.","2010-10-06 01:41:38"

Chubby's and Mama's tided me over until I could find suitable replacement.  Thanks to Larry's Steaks, I've rekindled my passion for cheesesteaks.

Larry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.

Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow.

We passed by this place several times knowing that once we moved in we would have to try it.  And OMG we where floored, the restaurant had great traditional ambiance and the service was top knotch.  They served glass bottle sodas which personally is something I love.  The food was amazing, my wife had the Taco Sombrero and I had the Chimichanga.  Both where amazing.

"z21E-jN4GncdagXtrjj71A",1,"As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, ""Please hold"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL.
My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL.
I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong.
I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy.","2013-01-02 16:36:09"

  Service was prompt, quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.

Was nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I'm sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  

I had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  

I wasn't to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn't recommend those. 

Also had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  

Overall I'd say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.

No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter.

"-8vXCk3ijlgP-7uDlV-THw",3,"We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.","2016-08-25 18:15:54"
"8Zdg9rvUktRgBps1aSne7Q",1,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like ""Oh Well."" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. 

At this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told ""No."" When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told ""Well, what did you want?"" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him ""I already to her that they could not move in here."" What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer. I would never recommend this place to anyone even if they were starving!","2011-02-13 22:31:28"

Whatever that meant. The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. 

I did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it's good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you're going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it's by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends! (splitting the meal violates the rules of the competition)

"5QU0DFF-8YZuWv98EFqnQg",2,"I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), 
a bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: 

The chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. 

The sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. 

The mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. 

The bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. 

The new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.

I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.","2014-05-07 20:24:38"

"IvWRvqzdhaa57iqvcrawvw",5,"Spot on!

I got ""the veg"" and the spicy fries.  ""The veg"" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

The atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small, so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely.","2015-07-16 16:55:53"

I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.

Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.  

I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.

Dan was effecient, quick and friendly. Great service. My girlfriend ordered a margarita, which was reasonably priced and tasty. To eat, we ordered the pimento cheese, skillet cornbread, shrimp & grits and the hot chicken. Everything was delicious. The pimento cheese had some heat, and the country bread it is served with gives it a nice touch of salt. The mollases butter on the cornbread was ""to die for"". The shrimp & grits was my favorite dish. Creamy grits, perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp. As for the chicken, they do not lie to you. It is hot. The brioche and ranch dressing compliment it well. For desert, we ordered the raspberry cobbler and a coffee. The cobbler was underwhelming. It wasn't bad - just not as great as the previous plates. Elixr coffee was spot on. Overall, I'll be back.

"gWjo1xuqnMvOSh_ZXWP6Hw",1,"Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.","2017-02-09 14:59:25"

The building is huge inside. One side is all windows so you can watch your vehicle move through. They even have a ""soap gun"" the kids can use to shoot their car. That was a huge hit. 

The cashier greeted me as I walked up to the counter. She took my coupon and handed me a receipt. I walked around while I was waiting. They have drinks she snacks for purchase. They sell lots of greeting cards for every occasion. They have gifts and accessories for your car. The building was cool inside which was great because it was hot the day we came in. I waited about 10 minutes and walked outside. They have a large covered area to wait under. It has some seating so you can sit and wait. After just a few minutes they yelled out my car make to say it was done. I handed the attendant my receipt and tip and I was on my way. Total time was 18 minutes which I think is fair considering they were packed when I arrived. 

The car was clean and vacuumed. Overall they did a great job. The only thing they missed was the front window. It had that haze on it that you notice when the sun hits its. I wiped it off myself. I'm sure they would have fixed it if I noticed before I left. Also, they don't offer free air freshener with the wash like most other places. 

This place was fast and they did a great job. The price was fair and the staff was friendly. I will be coming back soon.","2016-10-01 06:40:23"

This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick, I'll give them that, but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.

I said, okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$, 18.87$ with tip.


They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow, either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank, and they'll lose a new customer.

"i-2Z69kuP4jmq6PRU12zKg",3,"Trying to find a restaurant in The Big Easy that serves vegetarian is not an ""Easy"" feat

We've encountered many the restaurant who would tell us time & time again that they did not have or *would* not make something to accommodate veggie needs & it was such a letdown.....to this day I still remember 1 guy saying ""Vegetarian?  Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*"".  We still laugh about it....

Well, over the last few years, we're noticing more & more places recognizing veggies like to eat Southern / Cajun comfort food & they are starting to open up their menus to us! ( YAY)

Seeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!

Started w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone

Their veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce

Mains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not

Divine beets & roasted acorn squash

Polenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice

Yams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens

Too full for dessert, we left w/ happy tummies & thankfulness for a nice veggie night out.  A-OK night!","2013-05-07 15:06:51"

Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.

My only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake.","2009-05-22 02:19:58"

Speaking of the staff, they are amazing. Checking in is fantastic, Jasmine and Kayla are the ones I dealt with and they are both wonderful. The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great, the rooms are immaculate. What I love most about this hotel are the fantastic bathrooms, I'm not sure about the regular rooms, but if you get a king spa room, the bathrooms are absolutely amazing. You have a freestanding tub, and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive, incredible wallpaper, beautiful rugs, everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you're only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum.

They switched my brand from Acuvue to Air Optix and about 2 weeks after using the contact I started to experience pain, redness and irritation. I took my contacts out that evening and had red rings around both of my eyes. I tried contacting them via telephone and left a message as well as email, I failed to hear back from them in a timely manner so I reached out to them again and got ahold of them.

Eventually I did get them to agree to switch my contacts back to acuvue. 

In march I had another eye irritation and I went to Vanderbilt Eye Institue, they told me it was a continued reaction to the Air Optix lenses because I did not give my eyes enough time to heal before applying my new contacts - which was I was not educated on by Music City Optical when I got my new set of contacts.

"xfsO2gdkoiI2JzF8-S8elw",4,"This wasn't my first visit to the Italian Centre, but my last visit was many years ago and all I could remember was the huge selection of charcuterie and cheeses. Slightly overwhelming to say the least, meats and cheeses (at the time) I had never even heard of. With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. 

Fast forward a few years... 

My most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. 

I decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!

For pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge! 

While visiting the Italian Centre I suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry. The perfect treat before or after shopping.","2015-02-02 07:37:24"
"2E228X223kkH-KPZtydEYQ",1,"It saddens me to say this but I think I need a new nail salon. I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:

1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while ""greeting"" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi. 
2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me.
3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet. 
4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi
5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up! 

I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back. In the last 3 months, almost the whole staff has changed and these folks are not meeting my needs.","2015-08-06 22:26:38"

They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume.

Met friends for drinks and an early dinner. I was the first to arrive so I sat at the bar and ordered the house cider which is great and I followed that with the Oban 18 which is phenomenal so try it while you're there. 

Our dinner kicked off with the most amazing house biscuits and butter that will have you begging for the recipe.

The rest of our dinner was comprised of several selections from the First course menu. We had the daily oysters which were great. Followed by the Brussels sprouts, delicious but the crispy chicken skins were a bit of a let down, they needed more flavor. 

The smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalapeño jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish. 

To close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.

Now, I knew the cheese on the pizza was provel so it would taste different. I was really not impressed. It may just be a matter of taste preference. It was hard to separate each piece of pizza too.  Like, it wasn't cut all the way through. Not really a fan. So thumbs down on the pizza. 

What bumps the stars up are the T-Ravs!  I was hoping for cheese ravioli but the staple is a meat mixture. Boy...do they do it justice. They were the bomb!  The sauce with it was too watery but still tasty. I would order just the ravioli next time!","2016-08-04 12:00:03"

There is a huge patio and, even in the winter, almost the entire patio is still available because they enclose it.

This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. 

Another thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American ""Shaker"" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.

The shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here).

This is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is ""let's go back and work our way through the menu"" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.

It's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.

The atmosphere isn't like P.F. Chang's; it's loud and it does have a more fast food feel to it. I did, however, love the way it was set up; you order your food at the bar, sit down, and they bring it out to you in 5 minutes (if that).

"OfhNz0BnZ5oeEBkYrAgJlQ",2,"I must say I'm very disappointed, my two stars are for presentation and prompt delivery. I ordered the rainbow roll, white tuna roll, calamari and chicken lettuce wraps. Where do I begin? ok with the bad. 

I strongly feel that when you are delivering food that should be served cold, you don't put it in a bag with hot food because that equals mushy, warm sushi, which is what I got. The rainbow roll, which normally is topped with raw fish was topped with mushy avocado????? which I ended up peeling off to salvage the sushi. The spicy white tuna roll was very good.

The calamari looked like chicken fingers all the breading was falling off and it was under cooked, I took one bite and tossed it. Now I've had lettuce wraps before but mines came with an actual head of lettuce in a bag and chicken filling in a plate. It was not described this way in the menu at all.

"Ae1pBelbC7rOHHabRRc6Yw",3,"I came in here the other night for a  post-show snack after seeing a ESO performance at the Winspear. The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.

I think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.

I'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.","2015-06-08 22:22:04"

My husband ordered the trout sandwich, unfortunately, he was disappointed that it was basically a 'tuna salad' sandwich. He did not enjoy it. For dessert, we ordered coconut macaroons, which were good. Co-workers had mixed reviews, but one ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) sandwich, and he liked it.

"w-2ArstUogqF2gedtMUP_Q",4,"This is a really fun event for those who enjoy beer in all its forms. The drinks themselves were relatively cheap ($2-4 for a 4 oz. sample. Most were $2, some were $3, and very few were in the $4 range), however the food was really over priced ($6 for a small cup of fancy macaroni and cheese? really?). For the beer lover, however, there is a wide variety of tried and true along with the new kids on the block from local, national and international lines. Also, if you like what you tasted, you can buy it on site, with a Sobeys/Safeway liquor store right on site doing specials on the sampled brews. 

We went VIP for this event, however I don't think it's worth it. What you get: a glass mug instead of a plastic one, a beer and food class ($2 value) and a beer seminar ($2 value). If you do it all, or really value the glass mug, go for it! But for me, who just did the beer and food class, it wasn't worth it. 

My only complaint is for the venue, but for an event that size, you need the space. $16 for parking on top of your entry fee (though I guess most people would cab or Uber it there so you don't have to have a designated driver), and then you have to buy sample tickets on site.

After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash...

"UkgiuEekte7UaeGA_gBaTg",1,"I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.

Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.

Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  
I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. 

The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much?

For sure one of if not the best place to get a sandwich on the beach anywhere between St Pete Beach & Clearwater Beach. All orders cooked to order. Super Size, gourmet servings and great very friendly service from the owner. Artison sandwiches for the price of Subway. Great cook with well seasoned sauces and dips usually. I always go for the daily special. Today was 3 Shrimp taco's for $6.00 The shrimp were cooked perfectly and served on fresh corn tortillas with a Kiwi sauce with some fresh peppers. Just enough spice and fruit with the shrimp. DELICIOUS. I could have had 6 they were so good. Only drawback is this place is walk up with only bench seating outside. Not a problem given the food quality for me personally but some may p[refer to sit at a table. It's on the bench or to go. A great place if you are staying at one of the local hotel to walk to.

   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.","2017-04-07 22:36:07"
"qpSzt2U1bOz7V3tBeovMSg",1,"The worst Italian food I have ever tasted!!! I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd. The only reason we didn't go there is b/c it was out of the way from where we were going.  It's pretty far from where we live but always worth the drive. Everything is freshly made & u can definite tell the difference! I'm sorry Caruso, but I don't think my family will be coming here ever again!","2010-03-14 07:27:30"

"3EUIprHie45xiT75nJERbw",4,"If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. 

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp ""En Cocotte"" with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.","2013-05-29 14:29:00"

She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant.

"yWgut6sdmV66d8OeG1r9uQ",5,"The plan was to find a one-of-a-kind engagement ring. I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry, especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.

A co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience! 

From the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI, it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work, as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds, rings, etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge, but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.

When the time came I met up with GRI again, this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique, special, one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off, Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!! 

A reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).

All in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction. 

So do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them.","2014-08-24 19:21:27"

The reviews were great and I was desperate for good carry out, so we decided to try Pizzaville (is anyone else picturing JT singing - Bring it on down to Pizzaville?).  The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is great!  The pizza crust is between a hand tossed and thin crust.  Perfectly crunchy ends and just chewy enough in the middle.  Good quality cheese and tangy tomato sauce. I ordered it with just mushrooms and they put on a lot!   I also asked for heavy sauce.  They put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case I needed more. 

I can't decide which was better, the pizza or ""breadsticks.""  I say ""breadsticks"" because they were really more like garlic bread strips.  So buttery and garlicy, they were great even without sauce.  I'm ashamed to say I ate nearly the entire order myself.

"jOipugMhwQ9AW7iEUBmg1Q",4,"I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. The decor was modern and cozy. The lighting was appropriate for dinner but terrible for selfies lol. Our waiter was OK. He seemed to be very hyper and impatient. I almost felt like he was rushing to take care of us instead of genuinely trying to give us an experience. I ordered the Shrimp Breaux Bridge and it was tasty. Nothing to phone home about but it was good. My friend ordered the Balsamic Salmon and it was good as well. It kind of reminded me of an Asian dish. Another friend had the Pesto Crusted Idaho Trout. It was cooked and flavored very nicely. 

I also ordered the Zangria White which is a sangria that was supposed to include strawberries, blueberries and diced apples... and i only got apples. IF there is an item on the menu that contains SEASONAL FRUITS AND VEGGIES ETC.... DISCLOSE SOMEWHERE ON THE MENU THAT THOSE THINGS ARE OUT OF SEASON. It definitely wouldve made a difference in my drink order. But overall the sangria was OK.

"NiuxBtn6Om9wOwZtjmT4Hg",4,"Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge, I actually think that the burgers here are, dare I say it, better then flagship restaurants.
Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.

I've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.

Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.

Most important of all, they are open late on weekends.","2012-06-26 16:17:59"

I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover. That's important to me that employees stick around. So, my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically. She's picking up things that I'm totally surprised about.... Like starfish have two stomachs and octopus have 9 brains.... I didn't believe her and I had to Google them! I didn't read the Yahoo review, but people are always going to have mixed situations with whatever's going on for them.

We walk to the bus stop by our house, the bus takes us directly to the Sparks bus station for a whopping $2 each. No parking, no driving through crowds, and no paying for parking. Winning.

From the bus station, we head immediately to Great Basin to get a large Icky and Bitchin' Berry. Beer is a must for battling these crowds and the large beers are worth the price!

If you have the JA Nugget mobile app, it will tell you where every vendor is and show it on a map. No more mindless wandering looking for your favorite vendor. I don't have a favorite, but go off of recommendations from friends, co-workers, etc.

Some vendors take cards, but we always make sure to bring plenty of cash. 

Be sure to walk through the non-rib vendors too. We got a couple of hats this year, which are nice to have at the event, but are also great beach hats for next year.

Saturday was a whole day affair and required us taking a cab back home. But because there was practically no crowd on Monday, we were able to get a beer, some food, and still use our bus transfer to get back home. Food stops being served at 5:00 pm on Monday and the vendors also start selling off extra food at crazy cheap prices.","2014-09-09 21:39:19"

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. 

In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.","2013-02-22 01:57:24"

Their brunch buffet includes tons of seafood, an omelet station, pasta bar, carving station, custom sushi rolls, fresh fruit, salads, and the usually breakfast foods you'd expect at a buffet. I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

As if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! 

Unfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather.

"kEsanAa8W6x7EQnAK1p3VA",3,"I've been to Mount Laurel's On the Border over 50 times. I used to go to Don Pablo's but I fell in love with On the Border's chips and salsa (their chips are nice and salty, and their salsa is a little spicier).

When I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.

When I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.

As for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I've had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I'd give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.

While everyone seemed to be very helpful, or at least wanting to be, I'm not sure I received the best possible service. I ordered two slices of cake, one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake. Both were DELICIOUS, but it seemed like I waited forever to receive these, and when i did, it was in a cute but inefficient manner. The to-go boxes were stacked one on top of the other, with a loosely tied string around them. While I admire the aesthetics here, I would have much preferred a bag. Though, the worst part of my experience was the barista. I ordered an iced coffee with milk and sugar. First, he put ice in the cup and filled it halfway with coffee. He then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated ""I wouldn't know what and how much you want, I only drink my coffee black."" As I considered this incompetent statement, i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve. But no, he proceeded to fill the rest of the HALF OF THE CUP with milk. And then handing me the drink he told me I'd better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in. Not sure why I'd paid such a high price to practically make my own half-coffee half-mild beverage, I simply smiled and walked away. I ended up throwing out the drink as I could hardly even taste the coffee and I'm not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee.

"9Y9q2jsvXqhXN23HFNUX7A",4,"I visited Joe's on consecutive nights, one with a Living Social coupon.  The beef tacos on the appetizer menu were outstanding, and a great price which will ensure I order them every time I come.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes were just as I expected; thankfully, no attempt to ""fancy them up""; just tasty comfort food.  I asked for French dressing and bleu cheese crumbles on my salad, and they were generous with the cheese.  The salad was cold and fresh and crisp.

The reason I did not give five stars was the service. The first night, we weren't told of specials (ugh, saw them on the way out and would have ordered them!), and my friend's appetizer order was wrong. Drinks were not refilled often enough, and the waitress seemed uninformed about some of the items.  The next night, different waitress. We were one of only two tables, and still waited too long for her to return. She was unable to answer a question about a menu item, as well.

What we found was a busy place that actually knew how to operate with a full house. Our need were quickly satisfied with courteous and reasonably priced service. 

Since we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. 

For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred.

The take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.
The steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. 
The beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures.

The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm.

"m8TcpOEzbu_6UhuCkncnRA",3,"I think I would've given this place a 4/5 star rating if not for the lackluster service and attitude. The entrees were good, the prices were spot on, and the breadsticks were delicious.

Ahh, the breadsticks. This is where the attitude part kicks in. These things are advertised as ""as much as you want for free."" However, my buddy heads up to the front counter to request enough for our table of three only to be given a hard time from the manager that we're eating more breadsticks than what we ordered. Give me a break. Don't advertise what you don't want to deliver.

Even ordering was a chore. It seemed as if they had a new hire manning the register during the lunch hour rush. She was placing orders as to-go for people looking to dine-in and had to have the manager place orders for her. Not a good idea for a Friday lunch rush.

If this Fazoli's location can improve upon these things minor inconveniences, it'd be a great place to grab a quick bite.","2010-08-21 06:30:20"
"f5ArvHHL42OiuBIWoCFxpQ",2,"was on an errand-running run and remembered how ashamed i was at the state of my car the last time i looked at it - five minutes earlier, as i entered said vehicle.

saw the sign as i was about to turn into riverside plaza to make my groceries and decided it was time.  got the basic $12 tchoup and even though there were about 5 cars in the vacuum line ahead of me, my car was ready before i was done checking out the waiting area.  iguanas, parrots, ms. pac man ($1 a game?  the price of nostalgia, i guess).  not to mention the windows that look out into the auto wash system - which is really entertainment enough for me.  i'm not picky.

but then my number was up and i went out and inspected the results.  still some bird poop remnants on the hood and a few bugs didn't give up the ghost on the grill...maybe i am picky after all.  

don't get me wrong - it was better than nothing (which was what my car got in terms of washings since mid-january), but i'm missing my favorite car wash right about now.  their regular automatic wash with vacuum and window cleaning (i.e. the tchoup treatment) is $14, true, but those dudes are much more thorough with the elbow grease post-assembly line washing.

but that place is in los angeles, alas.  which is perhaps the best gauge of how pricey this place is: 85% as expensive as l.a., but 66.67% the quality.  worth it?  you do the math.  i'ma try a completely touchless system next time.  i reckon i'll get about the same results, but with no parrots or ms. pac-man.","2011-04-22 16:34:17"

"Gfi6Hv6x-pizu2t78EkYnQ",4,"This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). 

I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!

The service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value","2014-09-10 06:18:19"

"F7mWedmSAH9l5U6vmVq1IA",3,"This is the biggest and best location for HMV in the city. The prices aren't any different from other stores but they do have a larger selection of gifting (figurines,mugs,blankets etc) as well as the largest collection of titles that don't fit into what is new and hot at the moment. Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.

The biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging. Needless to say when it came time to renew the card I opted out.

Anyways to sum it all up I will say for selection and speedy service these guys get five stars but the prices as well as the sometimes slow ordering process drop it down to a 3.

I go on line and look up every possible hack to get wrinkles out of pleather. They all fail miserably. I just went back to Ross with that coat, no receipt, no tags and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is a young male with dark hair and black framed glasses. I tell him of my plight. He literally says go find what you need, no problem. WOW! You won't believe it, but there was my Camouflage coat, in my size, hanging there waiting for me. Oh the irony! They exchanged my coat and after all that I ended up with my Dream coat after all.

"nRW-tnKDxj-bZdxxaJxcVg",5,"Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (""Cookie Jar"" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!","2014-05-26 22:20:26"

Definitely hits the spot at the end of the night. To me, the amount of food you get for the price could be improved but I would not say that I feel ripped off. The amount of food you get is fair but I think it'd be easier to justify if you got a little more. 

There's plenty of seating. Despite being near a whole bunch of bar/club scenes, once you're inside it's easy to take a break and have a nice conversation. It is all very clean and well kept. The servers are quick and friendly. When I went there were only two guys working but they weren't busy so it didn't take too long. The entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things. On one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it.

I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.
They text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. 
We sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!
I got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.

Muriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.

The pizza, however, was pretty darn good. We ordered it deep dish to try their special cornmeal crust and were pretty impressed. 
The crust tastes a little bit like cornbread, a little bit like pizza dough, a tiny bit like grease (the good kind) and a lot like YUM!

I don't know if it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very good. It would be even better if it were a tad cheaper, and didn't get so crowded! But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!","2009-10-13 20:17:39"

The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them.

I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me.
I apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you.
Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would ""special order"" anything I wanted. I declined.
Apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it.
Too bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal.
Two thumbs down on Poblano's.","2016-01-17 06:36:24"
"PMekHp126TAwlR0Adh_XBw",2,"I like Deweys's primary because it's close to my house.  The pizza looks great and the crust is good.  My gripe with Dewey's is that the pizzas are just so salty.  We had the pepperoni, socrates revenge, and bronx bomber.  It's like a eatting a brick of salt.  I'm not sure if it's the amount of salt sauce combined with the salty meat, but the combo so overwhelming, I tastebuds are numb to any other flavor.  Otherwise, if they fix that, I would love it.  

As for the salads, they're a good size, but seems like something you can toss together yourself.  I usually not get because don't want to spend the money on it.","2012-07-16 00:12:59"
"NfK8lTbCB8hY1DYjwfhdtg",3,"I came in with high hopes and left with slight disappointment. 

Our server was super attentive, and very friendly; however I feel like the food was disappointing. Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. 

Feeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.

The chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.

So to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.

One thing I will note (that our server told us) is that they are very big on catering to food allergies (especially gluten).","2012-02-01 05:28:26"

The meat on the ribs had great flavor but was as tender as the bottom of my nikes.  Pulled pork had a sweet taste and was overall very good.  Baked beans were okay, cole slaw was very creamy and I would not gets those again (they have an after taste like lake water).

Silver in the city is always my go to first. They are always on top of the newest ""it"" items for your home and style. They also allow dogs in their store so that's a huge plus because I'm typically walking my dog when I stop in. 

The only reason I am not giving them five stars is that although their employees are super friendly, they definitely watch you. I understand the need for this because they have little items that probably get stolen a lot but I always feel like I have no privacy to browse and debate any purchases.

Of course I ordered the Grits and Grillades. Slow roasted beef with peppers and onions in a brown gravy over creamy Gouda cheese grits sounded perfect. It did not disappoint as it was so delicious!

"QGxr7ttcWFOMbSvGu92sEg",3,"On a recent trip to Port Richey, I selected Holiday Inn Express for a couple of reasons.  The main reason was the option of two beds (as I was sharing the room with my brother).  The other reasons were:  price, vicinity to my aunt's home and complementary breakfast. 

My family and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place/House when we're traveling.  However, since it was just my brother and I, I figured we'd give Holiday Inn a shot. 

+  The staff were very friendly and helpful.
+  Free wifi.
+  Breakfast was very good, offering both hot and cold entrees. 

-  Sadly, the beds were WAY TOO soft.  It felt as if the mattresses were past their life expectancy.  As a result, I didn't really sleep well for most of my three nights there.
-  The a/c was hit and miss with the lack of reliable thermostat controls. 

There was a pool and hot tub, but since I didn't utilize either, it wouldn't be fair to rate them.  There also a small gym that I didn't use either.

The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   

The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   

Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  

Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!

"rNLX7dCFdu6yxYb75UZHFg",5,"I went here on a Wednesday night and, though it wasn't busy, there were no open tables without a reservation,  except the tall tables in the bar area. It still seemed to be a very quiet place anyway. 

The location is not attractive, the street is dark and mostly empty at night, but the inside is stylish in a masculine, refined sort of way; dark wood, low light, maps on the walls and prints of watercolors depicting old Missouri scenes. It was a great place for a quiet, intimate dinner. They've got a couple of TVs up above the bar. 

They seemed very well staffed, as if each table had its own server. 

The menu is one page but very intriguing, I had so many questions for our server about ""what is this?"" and ""what is that?"" and he was totally nice and knowledgeable about the menu items. He seemed nervous and unsure at first, but he was friendly and made sure to check on us frequently. 

We decided to split 3 small plates and a side dish between the two of us and, honestly, it was a little too much food for just two people. Perhaps we don't have hearty enough appetites.

Their menu is so varied and interesting, it's really all over the map in terms of seasonings and ethnic origins but the main focus seems to be rustic and warming - at least at this time of year. I have a feeling they may change it up from time to time. I'm sure you'll get things here you won't find anywhere else. The prices are very reasonable, considering the planning and good execution of the food. You'd certainly find more expensive, and less original places in Clayton and down town. 

We ordered the smoked trout, the venison hot dogs, the mini monte cristo sandwiches, and the french fries. 

The venison hot dogs and the smoked trout were fantastic and interesting. The french fries were very well made, and the dipping sauces delicious. I was so impressed with these that I was then a bit underwhelmed by the mini monte cristos. Since everything else there seemed to have a unique spin on it, I expected them to do something original here as well, but they were just like any monte cristo you might have. They were very tasty of course, but nothing new.

They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!

Two of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)

We also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!

We passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved. Just no dessert, which is probably better anyway-we were so full! 

Go, you will not be disappointed. Just go before 7pm on a Friday night to ensure a table.","2013-08-03 14:14:48"
"xPtCEVsHpTSZyMWya9CU0A",4,"This makes my 6th or 7th time to Jackson's in the last 2 years and I thought that after tonight's visit they deserved a review. 

I had the panini Reuben.  Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. 

Salad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.

Presentation was a little sloppy. 

Like every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. 

They have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  

Wait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. 

The second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks. My trip tonight it was about 8 min. For a sat night this is not bad. But not great either. My bartenders were awesome and never left me wanting (except for getting my salad with the main course).

Overall a good experience and I will be back.","2011-03-20 02:08:12"
"guL3EekPoVB9UDyTQpq4NA",3,"I went there for a pedicure and gel manicure.  It was my first time and the reviews was what enticed me. I loved loved Young, who did my pedicure.  She was very friendly and has a very positive attitude.  She took her time with my pedicure and was very thorough with the massaging (which was the best part). 

Unfortunately Young didn't do my manicure.   I had a gel manicure that needed to be soaked off.  The owner did my nails.  She first scraped my nails with the cuticle pusher, but when it wasn't coming off fast enough, she used the drill.  I was really worried as I didn't want my nails to be thin.  But I just let her do her thing.  I'm usually not picky so when she was working on my nails I didn't watch what she was doing until I realized after close examination she didn't fully take the old gel polish off.  
Not only that, the polish didn't go on smoothly, there's are noticeable bumps on my nail bed and the sides of my nails weren't even fully covered.  

I am so disappointed.  I love Young, but I don't know if I'll be going back due to my experience with my gel manicure.","2017-06-06 20:04:33"

The owner came out to chat and made sure we'd gotten enough food and liked everything. 

The prices are incredible, and evidently there are some things not on the menu, such as oxtails, that are available. 

Also- it's a BYOB!

Will definitely return and tell everyone I know to try this place out. Worth every 5-star review- they're real, folks.","2017-07-08 17:44:16"
"5hyoySXbmaGDb792aFqpmQ",4,"This is a cool place.  I wonder how many people know that an Ouzaria is?  The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  

We brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. 

Okay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward.

"TI7f_5wqqH0W5sNpMjFPYA",1,"This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:

1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. 

2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, ""I don't know"" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.

3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.

4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a ""quick bite"" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.

I'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.","2008-04-29 20:03:45"
"MB53hHzv_IMAcLcQsLbReg",3,"I waited a long time to finally try this place and I have to say I was let down a bit. I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.

The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized.

I think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber, and I still go there just as often.

You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket, the ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side, and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.

I love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full, but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud, but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.

We had a great room with a spa and the shower had a steam room feature. The hotel also offered many places to eat and relax. The casino was very clean and a joy to be in even if you don't gamble like myself. However I did win 41.00 with a 1.00 slot machine :)  we decided to venture out finally to see Reno.

they also have locally raised meats, bread from local bakeries...it's just a great place to support local growers and makers. also there are always people wandering outside tending to the garden. it's a nice atmosphere. the only thing I dislike is the location - because I'm allll the way across town. that's not their fault, though.","2016-01-17 14:36:01"

The complimentary chips took longer to get to the table than my husband's salad did. Thankfully they had one of the nearby televisions playing a kid's movie to keep my 3 year old happy. Back to the chips, they are home made and were fantastic. I went the safe route and ordered a burger with seasoned fries. It was wonderful. My husband ordered the blackened chicken and while it was good it was a little over seasoned making it a tad too spicy. My daughter had the kid's macaroni and cheese. It looked wonderful but she couldn't stop eating the chips, LoL. The seating inside was a bit weird. There is a table about 2ft from the door to the women's bathroom. Maybe I'm weird for thinking it's weird but I ended up waiting until I got home to go. They offer a 15% military discount which was great.

The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks.

I really wanted to like it, and it has gotten so many positive reviews, so I thought it was a sure thing, but it was just a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not amazing. I had the costanza, and the fillings were tasty, but the crust was disappointing. It was way too bread-y, as opposed to doughy, and when I think of a calzone, I think of dough like pizza dough- this was not that. The calzones are a good size, but they were a little skimpy with the meat fillings. Probably the most disappointing part was the dessert- we got the apple pie calzone, and it just had a really weird spice to it- something other than cinnamon that I couldn't put my finger on. It also didn't have that many chunks of apples inside- it was almost pureed apple. Meh. 

I like the vibe of this place and it's close and convenient to where i live, so I really want to like it, but I just wasn't thrilled with it the first time. Perhaps I'll give it one more shot, but it seems a little overhyped!","2014-08-11 02:14:17"

And that's exactly what I ordered today.
The hashbrowns were undercooked for my taste, so next time I'll ask for them to be crispy/well done. Everything else was quite good. Better than the Cajun Kitchen on Chapala, but not as good as the CK in Goleta.

Thankfully all of the special requests that I DID make were taken care of.

I'm super picky about my breakfast. 
Who am I kidding...I'm super picky about everything, lol.

Large portions(leftovers for tomorrow), super affordable(more so than CK), and loved sitting on their well shaded patio(no patio at CK).
There was one server taking care of 5 tables, she was great and very cheerful. No complaints about the service.

Terraza means balcony/terrace in Spanish and that's exactly why I would come here instead of other breakfast places that don't have one.

If giving a review just based on the food, I would give it a two. The pretzels are ok, but the cheese dip is Velveeta nastiest. As a native Wisconsinite, I take offense at plastic cheese. Then, there's the pretzel bun sandwiches. I've sampled the chicken, brat and Italian sausage. It's pricey, considering it comes with potato chips (seriously guys?! Get a fryer!) and just ok. The buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming, especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door.

Lee How Fook is pretty small, but that didn't make it lose any points in my book.  I could see it getting really busy (especially since there are only about 10 tables available), so I would definitely suggest making reservations if you're going on a weekend.  The service wasn't bad, but when I asked some questions about some dishes on the menu, I had a hard time understanding what she was trying to say.  

Okay now to the main course - food!  For appetizers, we ordered the pan seared pork dumplings and sui mai.  Both appetizers were delicious and the dipping sauce was really good.  For the entrees, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken, pan fried noodle with shrimp, and pan fried noodle with beef and black bean sauce.  The sweet & sour chicken was awful - more sweet than sour - and the vegetables in it were really undercooked (pretty much raw).  (I do have to admit that I like things spicy, so maybe this dish just wasn't for me.)  For both pan fried noodle dishes, they were blah with a side of blah.  The beef dish was supposed to be spicy, but I just didn't taste any heat.  I left here full, but unsatisfied.","2011-07-28 12:45:48"

A beautiful day spent skiing at Squaw ended with my realization that I had lost our car keys somewhere on the mountain. I had Security call every lift we'd hit and they took my name in case the keys were turned in. Do I call Toyota? Do I have to tow my car back to SF? I looked up ""locksmith"" on my phone's Google Maps app and Alpine came up (their Truckee office). Jacob had obviously dealt with the situation before. He gave me a price quote in about 30sec and gave me an accurate time frame as to when he could get to Squaw. He even called when he was running a few minutes late.

"46kOE5ULctOGg1E70vQR4g",4,"I finally made it to Farmhaus last Saturday, and it was worth the wait.  

As expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

Service was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  

I would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.  I think I will head back for dinner when there is outdoor seating, as I think that would add to the experience.","2012-02-01 20:42:18"

The table next to us had an extra person added at the end, his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately, we are writing this restraurant off our list.","2011-05-27 21:44:25"

This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto.

the only things i'm a bit bummed about are:  1. they don't open until 8am on the weekends (i'm an early riser and would prefer to go a bit earlier than that), and 2. the only group fitness class they offer before work is a 5:45am spin class (i'm sorry, i just can't do spin that early in the morning).

this isn't the gym for you if you want all sorts of foo-foo stuff like a smoothie bar and massage and lots of high-tech equipment.  but if you just want a place to come and work out with nice people on good equipment, then you'll save some money by joining LA fitness.","2009-05-23 11:34:24"

"H4O_LiOwkni0cGZ6G1r5Qg",5,"Its a rarity that i give five stars for anything. But in comparing this tattoo shop to the others around Indy and how they've jacked me around i decided its simply worth it to give 5. The other places have cancelled on me at the last moment, even when i was en route to go get the tattoo, one guy didnt even remember me when i called the day before to make sure we were on schedule for the tat and yet another had the inks set out and asked me to sit down when he got a call that he needed to go pick up the kids at school - all of these places i scheduled months out in advance as well. So, here we are back at Metamorphosis where they actually like to run a business the way it should be. Honestly i have only had one tat done here by Trevor and at the time it was the most fun 4 hour rib tattoo experience i could have had. They act professional, not like the rock star wanna be's i tried to check out at other places. Just cool chill people who want your business here. Trevor gave me the tattoo i wanted in the place i wanted it even though i feel he would have given me honest advice if it were needed. When it came time to get the tat, he held his appointment and i was treated with respect and as though a customer should be treated. Honestly i dont think this place cost more than any other place where youll get good work. Prices are about average in my opinion for the quality of work done. Dont waste your time going to the other places and getting jerked around - ive already done the work for you. Its a shame too that they may have good artwork at other places but youll feel like less of a human going anywhere else. The artists are just as good here and youll be respected for your $.  And by the way, yes they do ask for a non refundable deposit so they know your serious which is no different than any tattoo place ive ever been to.

I called back a few hours later to try and determine who bussed my table and what management was on duty and was told that my organizer had indeed been found and was in the ""safe"". I asked about the contents of the wallet and discovered that everything was present except for a $100 bill that I had just gotten the night before. I have witnesses to the $100 bill being in the organizer. 

I went today to retrieve the organizer and met with the assistant manager, who told me it was not their responsibility to keep track of guests belongings and would not investigate the issue whatsoever. She would not approach the server, would not ask who turned the organizer in, would not ask who stored it in the safe and essentially told me it was not her problem.

I will definitely be ordering from there again. When I called to see if it was possible to veganize an online order, they instructed me to simply write vegan in the comments section.

First of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine.

The two things I will surely go back for more of is the Sausage and Pepper Pizza (capitalized - because I mean business) and some sort of puff pastry that has a white cream in the middle - I'm sure it has a name but it escapes me.  The pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick to it.  Im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately (fortunately?) for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator.  The cream puff cream was just awesome - couldn't pin-point the flavor (vanilla?) but I would prefer it to top every dessert I get from this point forward.

I also got a bunch of the other sweets (salted brownie, blondie, red velvet crumb-cake) and a few bagels.  All were good, but not great.  Was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels - whole wheat bagels usually suck.

What I didn't really like was the pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty bland for my liking - in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza - and the pepperoni was pretty sparse. I also didn't like being told 25 minutes, showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza.  The small shop + no chairs = awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour.

"gKWesqRgEvbiVogTyvk5Gw",1,"Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man, what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, ""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says, ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, ""Hey, just shout and I will get you something"", or ""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! 

Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it.

"qO--SRLwiNfGGKAPeSGHpA",5,"For a $16 haircut, I was expecting an OK-looking trim (all I really needed was some damage control - just someone to lop off my split ends and maybe add a few layers).  What I got was a very professionally looking haircut that works well with my face shape and made my hair a lot healthier and happier.  My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job.  I think it's important that the school has a series of steps and checklists their students have to go through to ensure they are giving you the best experience possible.  Just make sure you have a decent block of time in your schedule to relax in the chair!","2011-08-26 01:37:56"

"NoQnvAU6iiy8ZdYvxzkIeQ",2,"***Please note that if you lose something valuable you may not get it back. The person who may clean the vehicle may be a thief. I left in the car my radar detector complete with a case not logged in to their lost and found. When I check in my rental on 12/21 and returned 01/02/2018 to visit the counter they told me nothing was found. They also told me that for something with a case go missing was very unlikely. Yet they found nothing. Hmmm, I wonder how it can go missing when it was the only place I left it? I filed a lost ticket with them; Reference Number: 4355421, Reported: 12/21/2017.

They may think their employees may be honest but my $300 radar detector is nowhere to be found at their location. So? Yes, one of their employee's stole it. 

I'm a fan of the concept of picking your car. As someone who has been using the same rental place in St. Louis Airport for 8 months and counting. I can tell you they do lousy job at cleaning the cars. I'm always finding plastic bottles underneath the back seats.

I'm also finding a lot un-wiped of front seat and dashboard areas full of sticky substances. The cars are never fully clean as someone who rents from them weekly.

This location does a shitty job of making cars ready for travel. As someone who has access to the execute cars due to the amount of travel I do. They fail to meet some simple travel requirements you expect when you rent. 

Next time you rent look underneath the seats in the passenger areas and you may find plastic bottle under them.

I would love for them to review the cameras and see who cleaned the car so they can fire them on the day I returned the rental! I brought them thousand of dollars and I do expect a refund for the stolen item.","2018-01-10 03:12:43"

They are bigger in size of the ones I get in NYC and double the price ($6) but I can imagine the cost is a factor of limited demand (small lines) and pallets in NOLA for a gyro vs a po boy.

I was introduced to Jones at the YEE earlier this year. The food was divine. Comfort food to the max. Mac and Cheese that I could've eaten with a ladle, sliders, pigs in a blanket, delicious cocktails. Yum yum gimme some.

We came back with my mother and fell in love again. The calamari is the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Perfectly crisp, not rubbery, full of flavor. Yum.

For dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.

We came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent, juicy, the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.

I preferred my husband's halibut over my tuna. The tuna was good, but the halibut had more flavor, IMO.

"kPu2vPVMT0EQeQMKQu6QRQ",3,"I purchased a used 09 Rav4 from Glanzmann Subaru last month. Coming from TN, I chose to purchase this vehicle from Glanzmann due to its limited availability and attractive price. I communicated with sales on numerous occasions before committing to purchase from Glanzmann nearly 1000 miles from home.

The process was overall quite simple, though I felt we could have gotten alot more done regarding interstate complications prior to completing travel plans to purchase the vehicle. My only actual complaint stems from the vehicle's description. As an out of state buyer, I was at the mercy of the sales team to accurately describe and depict any conditional issues that might be of interest to a prospective buyer. Unfortunately, none of the issues with this vehicle were highlighted, depicted, described, or otherwise demonstrated throughout the entire sales process. I even asked the sales agent to, while on the phone, inspect the vehicle and describe any possible imperfection so that I could have no surprises upon arrival. I spent several hundred dollars in travel expenses to collect this vehicle, only to discover there were a number of aesthetic defects that deserved attention (large dents, cracked paint, cuts in leather). I had limited time and opportunity to react to these conditional flaws and purchased the vehicle - I had already flown from Nashville to Philadelphia! 

This is obviously a small family-owned dealership. I expected a considerably more honest and direct interaction and was disappointed with the outcome. The automobile is a fine machine, but the defects certainly take away from the value. Mr. Jeff Glanzmann, I implore you to make honesty your #1 policy.  I had the opportunity to purchase the same vehicle, with honestly similar defects, from a dealership in Atlanta for the same price. I opted to purchase yours, incurring not-insignificant travel expenses, because of it's immaculate description.","2012-10-08 16:45:58"

"euVECYOpDtICbbTl0NQfcA",3,"My girlfriends and I ate at the Creole House for dinner. Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of sautéed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).

So, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.","2017-01-02 04:29:20"

I read so much about it on Facebook and the likes......so reading and seeing the yummy pics; well I just knew it would be all that.....untill yesterday.....

Me and my bf Vince went to BlackFinn for Sunday lunch yesterday. The atmosphere was cool and it was really nice inside. The staff was pleasant as well, so I'm thinking ""hum...I like..."". We ordered  a couple of mojitos and we also had another drink, which was okay.  Time to order; I ordered the Cuban sandwich, hold the mustard, and add mayo instead....with Black Finn fries and my bf ordered the Prime Rib sandwich with au jus and the same fries.  We got our order, which took a bit of time but it was okay. Everything looked so yummy and I knew they were going to meet my expectations. Now mind ya, my bf put off going to BlackFinn since they day they opened and I've been on him to go here. So anyway, the fries were a bit salty, but good. I had a choice of two dipping sauces, which I believe were ranch and barbeque. Delicious! I bit into the sandwich and what did I taste? A mouth full of mustard!!! Eeewww!! Okay, did I not say ""hold the mustard""? So lo and behold, my food had to be returned while my bf ate his food. His beef about his sandwich (no pun intended) was that there was more bread than meat. I looked at it and I noticed the same thing. Also, the au jus was a bit low as well and wasn't enough for the sandwich.  So I'm like the little old lady from the back-in-the-day commercials saying ""Where's the beef?"" LOL. Wow! 

Finally, after he finishes his sandwich, my food finally comes out and guess what? They left the swiss cheese off the sandwich. WTF! Okay, so at this point I'm like ""forget it, just take it back."" How many times must I send my sandwich back to get it right? Now I must say that the manager on duty was accommodating and she took care of the check and apolgized for the errors. So for her professionalism and the fact that the staff was very polite, I give them two stars. Will I go back....yes I will give them another chance to redeem themselves, but all in my ear is my bf saying that there must have been a reason why he hesitated to come here and this is why.

"LmwytEOYMpiMur7NoT-qVA",5,"I have to start out by saying, why do those who like hookah not know about this place?! It was such a wonderful experience! Please hear me out!

My mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.
When you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).
This is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.
We smoked ""sex on the beach"" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)
What I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well. The older man and the young guy was extremely nice. The younger dude checked in on us and was sociable which was really kinda nice but not overbearing. 

If you want a low key, quiet and chill hookah bar, this should be at the top of people's lists.","2016-04-23 06:35:37"

True.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  

Viper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""
  
Me: ""Paige.""

Viper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""

Me: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""

Paige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  

Burger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  

Burger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  

If I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.","2012-01-03 19:26:16"

Mandala is very affordable, on par (if not less costly) than online prices and you get to test the products in person with no shipping charges.

"0UNBS0ZqMO6BOMQ0ryampg",3,"I went to my first BarreAmped class at the Music Row location (I've also been to bounce class - on a trampoline - at the Nations location), and it was a great class: definitely a better workout and a better experience than some of the barre classes I've taken in town since moving to Nashville in July. Had a very family vibe - everyone knew each other in my class except for me (a Class Pass-er trying it out for the first time). Great instructor - very hands on. 

The room is TINY, but luckily there were only six or seven of us in the class (it was a random class in the middle of the day on a weekday). The room is oddly shaped and very small, so if the class was full, I'm sure I would have been hitting everyone else with my arms and legs every 30 seconds. Another frustrating thing? BarreAmped is located within a house on 16th that is also a gym. The building does not say BarreAmped on it! No sign at all! It was my first time coming to this location, and I drove right past it and had to circle around to find it. Then, when I walked inside, no one was at the welcome desk, so I wasn't even sure I was in the right building! Finally someone came in (looked like something using the gym rather than working there), and she told me the BarreAmped room was the up the stairs. A bit confusing. I wish that information had been on Class Pass and that they had a sign on the building.

I've seen one or two machines that are not quite working right but the facility as a whole is pretty sharp & welcoming. You have tons of options of what to do classes wise, equipment wise...
My only 2 down sides are that I wish they were open a little later on weekends, but that's just me moving slowly on my time off. I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule. There are classes I'd like to take but they always run mid day, never really early, after work or weekends. So no option to try them.

It is a self service fro-yo establishment with countless options of flavors and toppings. I enjoyed the toasted coconut yogurt and topped it with rainbow sprinkles, fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. The fruit was very refreshing but it was hard to select what to put on it because everything looked so yummy. If you are a chocolate lover there are plenty of candy toppings to add to your fro-yo too. 

If you are not sure what flavor you will enjoy best you can sample them with small paper cups that so you don't have to find out if you like the flavor or not after you already purchase! 

Another plus is that the establishment is kept very clean and it still looks as new as it did when it first opening on Main Street just a couple of years ago!","2013-06-24 13:57:46"
"rgQX5YhiYbylslXq_OWKBg",3,"I think the trendiness of this chain, in general, has sort of faded and what you have left is the basis of this chain, which is over-priced food of a questionable quality. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's a whole lot of fried food and most of the breadings, whether it's fried pickles or okra or calamari or shrimp, are the same across all of that. The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality. Décor is pretty cool and this is parked right along the Boise river, though it's a bit tucked away and has to be more or less sought out...probably worth hitting at least once, but there are far better local places that are more worthy of attention.","2017-05-26 06:18:52"

Now I know the answer, and the answer is- not much. At least in terms of decor. There is a gumball machine, 2 empty candy machines, plus a counter to order at and that's pretty much it. Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.

I didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.

I got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.

I stop at Animo every time I go to Jersey to visit my family; or do I visit my family every time I stop at Animo?  Debatable.

Animo started with juice.  Not frozen juices with sorbet & yogurt added.  Real juice.  

Their menu has expanded & they now call themselves ""Animo Juice & Burrito Bar!""  The burrito menu features 10 burritos, all under $10, f my favorite the ""Haight & Ashbury"" is stuffed with rice, beans, meat/roasted veggies, cheese, lettuce, tomato, guacamole & sour cream.

Not that hungry, have a 'petito', a small version of the burrito, averaging $5.  Porky & Petunia - the name is as cute as the petito is yummy:  shredded lettuce, pulled pork & pineapple salsa.  

A breakfast petito & Animo MD juice destroy any hangover.  The MD is juiced greens, carrot, orange, apple, kiwi, banana & spirolina.   My BF loves the Chilly Palmer:  Acai, apple, banana, yogurt & flax seed.  

For a happy belly add or substitute the perfectly cooked quinoa to any dish.  The Border Salad is a perfect example: lettuce, guac, pico de gallo, cheese, tortilla chips, cilantro lime vin, & sub quinoa for meat.   

Fiber-full signature juices, frozen whipped bananas, sliced fresh wheat grass (cheaper than Jameson!) & yogurt/granola bowls!

I do believe they use flash-frozen sashimi grade fish, but the color, texture, taste and smell are perfect.  Easily the best spicy tuna I have ever had.  I think the secret is the kewpie mayo along w/ the right amount of sriracha and sichimi powder.  Frankly, I can't get enough of this place and have at times, eaten it every day for lunch for weeks.  I've gone as far as to pick it up for dinner AFTER having had it for lunch. Their introduction of short-grain brown sushi rice has been great!

The Sushiman, YC Park is amazing to watch.  I've seen him skin a cucumber with a sword-like sushi knife in no time flat, in a single ribbon and then continue to shave it into a nori thin sheet for his tuna naruto roll roll.  The temaki are as big as a carnival iced cream cone.  You can barely finish one of them, there is so much fish in there.  The nigiri are beautiful.  Uniform pieces of fresh fish, perfectly perched on the best sushi rice I've ever had (just the right amount of vinegar and sugar).

Skip the newly opened Kooma.  Save Mikimotos for a night out, but go to Tokyo for lunch!  The owners are lovely, so support them in this tough economy.  If you must eat sushi, eat it here!

I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but "" full synthetic"". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, ""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say ""it was good for the car and whatever"", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend.

Arrived at opening and found the off season price within reason. Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. 
A star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I've been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. 
I can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others. But I think if your timing is right, you could have an enjoyable afternoon.

"ZLs_Dc_Gre6EN-zljVBY4g",4,"I normally wouldn't think Greek food for brunch or lunch; I'm way more of a traditional American-style brunch kind of guy.  But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.

Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!

The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).  Can't wait to come back and try out the dinner menu.","2011-02-13 20:39:21"

I don't understand why they slice the meat the way they do but it makes for a disgusting sandwich. The people raving on how good this place is are just locals who have never had anything better.

Then, one day a couple of years ago, I wandered into Andre's salon and I never looked back.  
Andre is warm and personable and made me feel at ease immediately.  Right off the bat, we connected on a topic I care about--dogs--and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  Oh, and the cut and color were fantastic!  My highlights last longer than highlights I have received from any other salon.
For the past year or so, Christopher has been styling my hair and I LOVE him to death.  He is incredibly sweet, down-to-earth and talented!  My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and, try as I might, I can never get it to look as good as he can.
The last time I was at the salon, Christopher, Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about '80s fashion!  I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!).
Also, back in the spring, I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize.  Being the wonderful person he is, Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race!  Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon!
I also love that clients can schedule appointments online through schedulicity!
Great prices, great cuts, great color, great space, convenient scheduling options and, most importantly, great people--you will not regret choosing Andre for your next cut or color!","2010-11-22 18:31:57"

Not too loud at all - conversations were easy and a lot of the patrons were doing just that. There's a jukebox, so maybe it cranks up later in the evening. We were there pretty early. 

Great service from several people working behind the bar. 

Several beers on tap including a local CCCCC IPA, which was solid. Not many wines, though.

Small menu but very good food. The elote (corn) is quite good, as was the cucumber(?) salad. But the brat plate was the star. Wonderful brat, German potato salad, sauerkraut, pretzel and a hot salsa/relish. Best brat plate ever. Served on a cool wood board.

Prohibition is located in or near a somewhat dicey neighborhood, at least to this non-resident's eye. I may very well be wrong about that.

First of all, accolades to the staff they could not have been more helpful.  Especially Thomas in the meat section.  For these two things I would give them a five.  However, it does downhill from this point on:  ordered one pound of swiss cheese, after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes, and no one else was on line, the unfriendly clerk waited on us. The imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese, rather than many slices.  I bought ricotta cheese for Easter and went to open it, and it was bad, although it was dated 3/28.  The tomatoes on the vine that I bought on Friday were bad by Sunday.  I have found their prices very high, selection, poor and at this point it is just not worth it. I also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par.  Very dry and tasteless.. Overall a very disappointing shopping trip 
There is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate, but it is not for me.  The final straw was that I asked for extra cash for Easter gifts, the clerk at the register said there was a $150 limit, the ATM terminal said $100 and the ""manager"" said $50...I thought they should get their act together.

Since Friendly's closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). 

Much to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.

After much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn't that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. 

The service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work.

In response, the new crew touted the place being cleaner and it was.

I got the  classic burger and fries.  I'll be honest, it was the worst $11 burger that I've ever had.  Dry and flavorless and made me envy a $2 McDonalds bacon burger flashing on the TV.  The fries were OK.

I was shocked to just walk in at dinner time.  This wasn't possible before.  Now I know why.

I got a few items to share such as a Burbon Pecan cookie, chocolate chip cookie, vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing, and a vanilla cupcake with raspberry icing. 

I had a taste of the Burbon Pecan Cookie. It was not too sweet and you get nice bites of pecan; a nice hot coffee is a perfect compliment.The cupcakes were good (cake wise) but, not a huge fan of the icings. The cake itself was sweet and moist.

I ordered the gyro and fries which were surprisingly really good! Gyro meat was tasty and the fries were awesome! Bf had the French onion soup and potato skins which he said were good as well.

Get there early or if it's a blowout, stroll around the park. There are tons of interesting places to eat & drink (including a rooftop bar). Tickets are still amazingly reasonable even after all the success the Phils have had in recent years particularly when compared to the NY parks.

I used to go more often before the team became so prominent (right after the park opened), and I sat all over the joint. Not really anywhere I wouldn't recommend. The outfied is a great option. 

After starting with a 17 game pack many years ago & then buying season tix a few years back (which my company still has), the staff was great about recommending sections that would avoid direct sunlight , etc. (3rd base field level is awesome).

If you are visiting or considering a trip, don't buy the negative publicity about the Philly fans. The crowds are great. Sure, you have idiots and maniacs like you do at any park and for any professional sporting event, but they are by far the minority and Citizens Bank Park is policed pretty well for nonsense. 

I was once with a group of guys & we stood out in one of the open standing areas between 3rd base & the left field wall the whole night. At one point a very nice officer politely asked us not to curse because there were families around. We we were far from out of control, and we all thought that was pretty cool... so we had fun with some occasional lighthearted banter with the officer for the rest of the night.

Don't expect to be sheltered with your kids like you would be in your own living room, but there's no teens running onto the field getting tazed every night nor are there drunk idiots throwing up on people.

If you're looking for quality meal that is quick and affordable, the Fountain has you covered. The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  

Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.

I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.

For my side, I chose their ""spicy carrots"" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.

Our food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.","2015-03-19 04:54:53"

I would recommend the Woodstock - the Jack Daniels Maple Ketchup is out of this world, and Benton's bacon is always delicious.  Upgrade to the truffle fries; they're to die for.  Or, if you're a vegetarian, the troyathalon is a great option.  Filling, with great texture and flavor.  As far as drinks go, 12 South Lemonade.

The customer service is also great.  They've always been attentive, but not ""on top of you"", and they're very knowledgable about their food.  Parking can be a bit difficult at certain times of the day, but it's worth a short walk if necessary.

I probably should'v left and tried the next time since I was not happy when I was seated due to the waiting.

I knew I couldn't eat the full-course meal so we decided to get cheese fondue and one of their entrees. Cheese fondue was delicious. If I go next time, I would probably just get the cheese fondue. =]

And the entree we had.. was some chicken, meat, shrimp, mushrooms, etc. We decided to go with oil instead of broth because that's what our waitress suggested and I didn't really like it. I think I will try the broth next time if I do and see if I like it any better. Except the mushroom with stuffing, others were ok.

We had this private booth which was very romantic and nice. I think this place would be good for people who want privacy and have plenty of time for dinner. We stayed there for 2&1/2 hours excluding the waiting time.","2009-08-03 18:49:36"
"Sfe6Zhv0pMvWAzDV8yPEKA",5,"Great Mexican BYOB! I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... 

The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. 

I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  

The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!","2014-02-05 19:40:04"

"7ClhTTKdCdP_rP7dervcjg",5,"I'm not really sure why I bother going to other restaurants. 

Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute, new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews. 

Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".

This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations, no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood, which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table, my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".

We got there, were told there was a little bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.

We both got the filet, done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say, possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry, Dad). 

Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere, the staff, the decor, the food, hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will. 

Next year....we'll just go straight to Jones.","2011-02-13 16:34:38"

"x0dvemSqhJL8M8d3zPrsZw",5,"This shop is a slice of Disney beauty and magic hiding on the edge of Broad Ripple, and a MUST stop of sweets, treats, and dreaminess. Your Instagram needs this place. Hands down the ~best~ red velvet cake of my life.

Appearance: The Cake Bake Shop is a beautifully decorated, small white house with a captivating design. The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.

Inside the Cake Shop will take your breath away, light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights. This isn't the kind of cake shop you do take-out at, you'll want to sit and enjoy. 

Food: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake, unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while, so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE

I was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. 

Price: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.

Customer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! 

I will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!

There isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said, so I will just reiterate some of the reasons why Taste of Havana will become a regular spot for us. 

I had the Pan con Bistec, and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back! 

And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love. 

Try it out. Order a sandwich, have a seat, chat them up, and enjoy! I'm already looking forward to our next visit, and thinking about who else I want to bring with us.

"CDShGHA0UPSedh18S5K3eg",4,"I eat at Sukho Thai quite a bit, and I don't really get the negative ratings. Is it the most authentic thai place in the area? No. Sometimes I would say they sometimes substitute certain ingredients. It is however usually pretty consistent as far as quality of food and service. 

I usually get the red or green curry, and almost always get it ""native thai hot"". I have tried other things on the menu, but they are not quite as good. So I stick with what tastes good and works for me. 

The lady that owns the place is very kind and always very gracious to my wife and I. She always recognizes us and serves us promptly. She not only owns the place, but she waits all of the tables most of the time(which I think is pretty impressive). 
The place is beside a go-cart track, so that makes it a little quirky, but it's something I have grown accustomed to. 

The only thing negative I would say is that I wish they had Kee Mao on the menu, because that's my favorite. I usually go to Siam Cafe or Thai Star for that.","2011-09-25 22:30:48"
"x-OF89Y84uXvSRbeIskdfQ",5,"When you dine at Muriel's, check to see if the 2nd level is open for visitors. If so, you can briefly tour the lounge area upstairs (red couches, decorative pieces). There's a wrap-around balcony where you can get a great view of Jackson Square. 

If you're curious, learn why Muriel's is haunted and find out the story behind why there's a table that is always set for two located near the stairs. 

There are two main dining rooms, a middle section (indoor patio dining area) that I personally prefer because it is quieter, and a bar area located at the back near the restrooms. I love the indoor patio dining area because it brings a bit of the outdoors in a quiet indoor setting. 

On my first visit, I ordered from the dinner pre-fix menu which is a great deal (appetizer or soup + entrée + dessert = $40). The seafood gumbo soup was hearty and delicious. The dijon mustard encrusted salmon was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was a great way to end a delicious meal.

I returned to Muriel's for lunch on another NOLA trip and tried the wood grilled pork chop. The pork chop was flavorful, tender, and moist. I was not too crazy about the red beans and rice it was served with as I found it a bit bland. The entrée was served in a bowl but should perhaps be served on a plate since it was difficult to slice the pork chop since it kept sinking into the bed of red beans and rice.

"fE2DRDTFrCFa47tqeYmXlQ",3,"I like to make a stop at this Walmart since it's located in Meadowlark where my doctor's office is.  It's smaller than  the supercentre but I find it has a decent selection of items in the food section where the prices are cheaper than the nearby stores.  The produce section can have limited items though with just the basics in stock.  I find the snacks and canned food section are fine with good prices.

As for the rest of the store and items, well it's hit or miss.  I was looking for lightbulbs and they only had one brand of the type I was looking for and it was a energy efficient so pricier than others if they had in stock.  However, the price I paid for the item was probably cheaper than other stores.  

Don't expect much help if you need help finding an item.  Associates seem to be difficult to find unless you count some of the younger staff who like racing shopping carts in the store as they were on my last visit.

"P9AMB0FwC26Uhc1MFrknAw",5,"Okay, first review, and I don't even live in Philly anymore. But now in Houston, I'm feeling the loss. 

I'd say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a 5-star review. First, the impersonal stuff. Modern office, computerized charting, accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting), the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at, convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.

The second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient, she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits, that never changed. Without going into medical details, she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests. 

All in all, I can't imagine a better doctor. Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn't live for any length of time?","2010-10-05 19:13:44"

As much as I'm woe to admit this, 15 years after indulging in my last hot dog, I was expecting something of bratwurst - or at least ball park - thickness. The dogs were good. The bacon wrapped dog made it better.

The buns are okay.

But Hot Diggity is made by its delicious fries - eat them with the vinegar sauce...and only the vinegar sauce. Everything else tastes like the same sour, sweet, or spicy variation of Kewpie. 

The sodas are fun - the unfiltered Ginger ale with real chunks of ginger floating around is unique and tastes more healthy than harmful. (No, doctor, I swear, all I had to drink was heart healthy ginger....)","2012-01-03 16:55:22"

The must haves: 
Mussels in red curry sauce (Cha Mussels): creamy, savory, and a little spicy. I poured the red curry sauce over everything.

Prat-Hee: Minced pork with raw veggies to dip (eggplant, peppers, cucumbers, etc.) It's a little bit oily and a little bit salty but extremely flavorful and satisfying 

Chicken Curry (or whatever they have as a special): potatoes and chicken and a delicious warm soup. Perfect for winter days. 

Papaya salad is also great for something light and fresh!

They place really, really cool music!

(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)

Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  

Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.

Major points for:  
*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  
*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!
*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.
*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!
*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.

I do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  


For a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  

Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  
Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)

For about 5 minutes and the waiter 1 came over and took our orders. Bacon and eggs and one of the salad combinations. Waiter 2 brought us a water and coffee after another 20 minutes and said our order was good. About 30 minutes later we got refills.

Then when the bill came we were charged $10 for an $8 item and $10 for a $6 item. That took about 10 minutes to correct.

All in all an absolutely MISERABLE experience.  Nothing would make me go back. First time I my life I left a zero tip.

It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee.

When we asked for a refund, the spa manager, Dawn, was aggressively rude to my mother as she said refunds were not an option. She offered us day credits but since we are from out of town, this wasn't a viable option. Only once we asked for the hotel manager and waited for almost 30 minutes at the checkin desk did someone (not Dawn) apologize for the hassle and let us know we wouldn't be charged for the treatments we didn't receive in a mostly facility unprepared to host us anyway.

I travel a lot for work and enjoy finding new places. Pia is my new favorite. 
Nicole is a breath of fresh air. She should be teaching a course on customer service and facials. I've had plenty of treatments, but Nicole's sandblasting and scrubbing topped them all. How refreshing to walk out of a salon having had your expectations exceeded. The room was calming, the atmosphere peaceful and the products used were first rate. I had the $175 ninety minute procedure. Shoulders, arms and feet were all thoroughly massaged and my face has never been cleaner. I even looked twenty years younger when I left.

"eyRiU7tk6KrOSuNA7uOu3Q",5,"I recently had my wedding trial hair and makeup done here and was very pleased with their work. Regina did my 1940's-inspired updo and did a thorough and professional job. She also did my mom's hair which is short and coarse and made her look like a movie star.

Regina was great, but the real star of the show was Chrissy, the makeup and skincare expert at the salon. Chrissy did my mom's makeup first and made her look so glamorous, and explained each product and process step by step and took my mom's adorably earnest questions in stride.  

When Chrissy did my makeup, she suggested a few bold choices and I agreed to see how her vision might work in addition to what I had been originally thinking. I was looking for a very retro look but she had the brilliant idea of punching it up with a more modern lip color, and she was SO RIGHT. it was instantly like having a friend do my makeup -- we chatted and laughed throughout the whole application process. She made me feel right at ease and I was just blown away by her skill, keen eye for color, and knowledge of my kind of skin and how to make the best of it.

As are as the food goes, everything was outstanding! Even though I had to drive home to eat first, my food was still hot. I got The Original Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a side of Tomato Basil Soup & Mac N Cheese. The sandwich was perfectly grilled, the bread was buttery, and the combination of cheeses were exceptional. The Tomato Soup is a must! It is creamy, and very filling. It pairs perfectly with the grilled cheese and I don't think I could skip out on it. The Mac N Cheese was good but I think it could have been cheesier than it was. The bacon on top was great though, and I could really taste the smokiness in it.

However, I had such a great experience at this location, I decided to write a review. I've been to many Apple locations from NY to Fl over the years and I can't say the same of my experience.  As busy as they were, I was able to get an appt with the genius bar right away. I had two broken 4S iphones that needed to be looked at but I didn't clarify that I had two devices when I made the appt, Nonetheless, after the  Genius bar tech, Tim, took one of the phones, Guy Schiavi who was on the floor, made sure that the second phone was looked at as well. It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween's iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.  He also provided recommendations on phone accessories for me which I found very useful.  Unfortunately, the first phone (mine) was not fixable but my daughter's phone was fine.  More than anything, it was all about the pleasant experience and the special attention we received from Guy.  I will definitely return to this location for any future Apple needs!","2014-08-24 20:13:04"
"XbpqQNHTgeMNEou-bCeLYA",5,"This is a gigantic restaurant with ample seating and a nice ambience. 

Beverages: This is the perfect place for cocktails, coffee and  cider. There is a wide variety of drink selections, and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu 

Starters: The New Orleans BBQ shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo. These little guys are like crack, and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce 

Entrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic, though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious), and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying. 

Dessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar, but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey, gooey, rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick, as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu, and not one of them has been a disappointment.

"crh-tVuzDBYQ5bGDL4K_GQ",4,"I went the first Friday that they were open with my husband, my mom, and a friend. There were some high highs and a few lows. 

For the table, we started with 4 of the small plates for $16-- the hummus, the hot potatoes, the olives, and the pickles. The hummus was incredible and a really large portion. The hot potatoes had great flavor but were served in a tiny bowl-- each of us was able to only have one small bite. The olives were served warm and were quite tasty. The pickles were a-okay, but I probably would not reorder these. 

For our mains, my mom and I split the trout, my husband had the roast beef sandwich, and our friend had the burger. The trout, in my opinion, was overly charred and lacked seasoning. Also, it was a whole trout, which, to be fair, is stated on the menu, but I do wish that the server or waitress would have explained a better way to debone the fish or offer to do it for us. We ended up with a weird pile of fish after we butchered it. The highlight of the trout was the potato gnocchi salad served on the side. OMG it was INCREDIBLE. I would order the subpar trout again in order to get this gnocchi side. 

My husband did not like his roast beef sandwich. I think he was expecting more of a French Dip, and this was more of a cold cut sandwich. The tomato on it was mealy, and he found the onion jam to be a bit too sweet. After a few bites, he gave up and focused on his side of kale slaw, which was very tasty. (The manager did take this off the bill).

The friend had rave reviews on his burger and fries so those are a big thumbs up. 

The manager came around to check on our meal, and we gave him his honest feedback. He seemed appreciative and brought out two desserts-- the brown sugar panna cotta and the peanut butter banana whoopie pies-- on the house. These desserts were definitely highlights so I would recommend saving room for the sweets at the end.

Service overall was fine for the first week. Some low points were that my drink (the Outsider) took 45 minutes to get to me and tasted strongly of lemon. Our waitress also took away our apps before they were finished-- this is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially because the olives, pickles, and hummus could have been used to jazz up the flavor of the trout. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back and look forward to them working out their opening week kinks.","2015-12-20 20:49:58"

I am always at my happiest when I know I can rely on an Authentic New England Seafood Market/Shanty near me. Oh and did I mention Affordable?!?!

I can't think of a visit where the Lobster Haven staff has not been helpful in assisting me in plucking out my Lobsters from one of their many tanks along with their fresh Ipswich Steamer Clams just chillin' in their very own cozy tanks. They'll steam them up for you right there should you choose, bring them home or relax at one of the few tables within this Lobster Shack or in their newer room to accommodate a larger party.

Among the traditional New England staples such as Ipswich Clams, Maine Lobster, Sea Scallops, Cod, Haddock &/or freshly made Clam Chowder, etc... They carry a ridiculous variety of other fresh and frozen Seafood from our Gulf Coast Region, i.e.; Spiny Lobster Tails, Key West Pink Shrimp, Royal Red Shrimp, Grouper, Snapper, Redfish, Mahi Mahi, Jumbo Prawns, etc...

As for the teriyaki and non-sushi dishes, they are great as well. The only thing is every once in a while the chicken is a little over cooked and crispy... kind of a bummer.  Overall, the portions are BIG and very satisfying.

"tve5dngx_pz-QBIc1BAVHw",5,"One of my favorite places in town. This is a hole in the wall and not a place that you come to sit and enjoy your meal. It's really best to take it away, because the dining area is usually a little dirty.
Family-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.
I mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.
If you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.
The best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!
I'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building. But, if you can get past that, then you'll find the food to be great.","2009-05-21 14:19:14"

Lunch was pretty good. 

Breakfast was where this place failed. The Ranchero Classic Breakfast Burrito that I ordered sounded great on paper, I was able to add chicken and was really pumped up about starting my day with a nice wholesome burrito!  

The execution is where this fell flat.  When I got to my car, i realized that the burrito was just slightly warmer than room temp.  The ""grilling"" process did not sear or seal the tortilla, and there were no grill marks or cheese melting that would evidence any type of honest grilling process.   

The idea of eating room temp eggs and chicken really weirded me out... but I had a bout $8 bucks invested in this roll of disappointment, I was already at my office and did not have an alternative breakfast...so I begrudgingly ate most of it.

If I go back for breakfast, I will stick with the smoothies.   those seem to be easy enough to pull off and very nutritious.","2016-03-18 13:10:43"

I stayed for 4 days with my twin sons.  It was clean, quiet, close to all the sights and everyone we encountered was very helpful.

This hotel is beautifully decorated, it features a nice inside courtyard with atrium and there is art work throughout---it isn't rundown and beat up like many of the other hotels.  They have done a great job keeping this establishment in great shape.

We had no issue with street noise and we stayed on the second floor, on the Girod street side.  Housekeeping did a great job freshening/cleaning the room everyday and my son's loved the rooftop pool each evening.  They also have a very nice fitness room as well, and all the equipment was up to date and functioning and CLEAN.

We didn't dine in the hotel bar/restaurant, but it looked very good and there was often great aromas wafting into the common area when we walked by.

I brought my own mi-fi hotspot so I can't attest to the internet

There's lots of things to do near the hotel that aren't the standard French Quarter sights.  So, be sure to check them out.  We enjoyed going to Fulton Alley one night during Happy Hour for some great family bowling and across the street there's BARCADIA which has loads of old school 80's video games and other cool games for patrons.

My friend and I made the mistake of coming here after being famished after a long day. Hey Johnny Rockets, I understand that you guys can get busy, but a quick acknowledgment that we existed would have sufficed. After finally waving down a waitress, we finally got a menu with a heavy sigh on the side as if we were troubling the staff. I urged my friend that we should probably leave, but we had already waited long enough, so I reluctantly ordered.
I got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle. Even the chocolate shake that I ordered was pretty good with a good consistency, but the taste of bad service still lingered and eventually overpowered the chocolate flavored concoction. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this location if it continues to be managed so rudely.","2013-03-19 11:01:52"
"Ti1_Kfd5RvRoonRo98BGcg",4,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. 

The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. 

The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. 

The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!

Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.","2013-01-28 18:42:40"
"Hf-p1iY7jo1zUR6HtI6ZDg",3,"Chicken was awesome! Loved the char and the garlic marinade. I can't say the same for the rest of the meal! Rice was cold but flavorful and probably would have tasted better if it was warm and dryer. The hummus was average and the falafel was just awful. I'm Arab so I know my fair share of felafel. This was not even acceptable in my standards for America! Everything was fresh though which is why I gave it a 3 + epic chicken. Not worth the wait and the possible risk of being yelled at. Too much hype for just the experience.

"mTl5iapYFmoNqwgD54dY6g",3,"Full disclosure: I have no experience with their food (other than the free chips which, meh). The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.

I walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.

The service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.

My most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.

It's not the best place around by any stretch, but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday, you'll find me at Cactus.","2010-05-14 16:16:09"

We sat for ten minutes without acknowledgement and were finally greeted by the frantic manager. He brought us waters and promised a server would be over immediately. Another five minutes passed before our overbearing server arrived. She only had two tables. She tried to offer us more time to look over the menu, which we had practically memorized by then. We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts.

I could eat a large bowl of the foie gras soup with the flavors of thai chilies and lemon grass. Both pastas were divine - the rigatoni with carrot top pesto with rabbit (prob the best dish of the night) and the saffron bucatini with blue crab with a little spice from fresno chillies. We had the fried game hen and the tile fish for mains. The tile fish was fine but couldn't compete with the flavor explosion of the game hen although the shrimp dumplings were tasty - wish there were more.

"dNXs84rjPLUoFuwhhGtcdg",1,"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.  
Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.
Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!
When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick ""sorry"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.
As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.  
I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.","2017-01-14 23:17:25"

You probably wouldn't notice the place unless you were looking for it, but it's less of a dive inside than you would think, i.e. chain-fast-food-restaurant-style chairs and tables that are anchored to the ground and commercial signs designating the soda and salsa bars.

We ordered two tacos each, with the beans/rice/drink combo as well. We probably should have split one of the combo plates as the walk home was a bit more of a waddle. The fish tacos were decent, but I've had better.

The fish itself didn't have much flavor so most of the taco's taste came from the toppings. I'd try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!

This cafe had good reviews, so we figured to give it a shot.  We were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from.  The food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable, but nothing out of this world.  We probably would have considered to go back if it weren't for the service.  Immediately after our food was brought to our table, the check was placed down, never asking us if we were going to want anything additional.  We sat down at 11:00am, the food came out pretty quickly, but by 12:00pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner.  There were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down, but for some reason it had to be our table.  I could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line, but there were several open tables and only 5 people (not groups) waiting to be seated.

We eat here quite regularly but I witnessed something extremely disturbing and unsanitary today that I would really like to consult management about. 

An employee who was both taking cash and serving food proceeded to grab fruits with his bare hands (unwashed) then wipe his hands on the back of his pants. He then went back to taking orders where he used his arm and same hand to wipe his nose, sniffed, and touched his hair.

I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did.

We split an order of the fried egg rolls + each got a bánh mì. The soups looked tempting but the bowls were so big! He got another pork belly bánh mì and I got the grilled pork. Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.

Afterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.

The guy running the place was very nice, too. I asked him to explain what the condiments were on the table because they were labeled in Vietnamese, and of course he did. We didn't use fish sauce or hot sauce or vinegar but it's nice to know they're available.","2013-10-03 14:46:05"

Ordered the Lobster Risotto w/ shrimp and lobster. There was about 3 pieces of lobster total in the dish, but the taste was well rounded and creamy. It was filling, adequately satisfying and nothing special.

What saved this from being a 2-star review was the fact that I tried my friend's Straw and Hay, which was stellar. The toasted ravioli is also one-of-a-kind: not a cheese bomb like other places and extremely balanced in taste. They weren't stingy with the filling, either.

They no longer have the Mongolian grill at the buffet. None of the Reno buffets come close to the ones in Las Vegas, but for the $, this one is still ok. Just not worth going out of your way for anymore.

Now to the soup,I ordered chicken with noodles and vegetables my son ordered a spicy beef and vegetables soup.

"tihRUWXPPyn4tXOvpOnH4A",1,"I lived in Lincoln Green Apartments from September 2003 until June 2009.

1. I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one. 

2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless. 

3. When my rent was over, I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow. However, a few years after, I noticed a ""Collection Notice"" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said ""  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet"". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them, I faced bunch of rude people with no respect, what so ever, to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent, they hung up the phone on me. 

4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm, don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors. 

Two of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.

I strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:


1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers
2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants.
3. Their inadequate care for apartment issues
4. Poor security. 
5. Very poor sound proofing of the walls which transmits every single sound to all neighbors.

"bfhg82P-td1Wuk-_-ZnheA",4,"We took a group to Fox & Hounds after reading they were serving hot cider by the fireplace!  We informed the waitress we were looking for the hot cider and wanted to sit by the fireplace.  She showed us the indoor area which is pretty small but very cozy (it would be great in the winter!), she took us out to the poolside terrace which had cabana areas with one fire pit where someone was sitting.  We were extremely disappointed.  

The waitress offered to take us to the courtyard area and have someone start a fire over there for us.  I thought this was extremely accommodating!  So we opted for a table in the courtyard and someone came to build us our own fire!

The waitress then told us that the kitchen didn't know anything about the cider but they had called the head chef and we're going to make it for us.  I thought it was very strange they would advertise something and then not even know about it, but I think they made up for it by making sure we still got it.

I actually ordered wine and a few of the guys ordered beer.  The other members of our party ordered the cider and it came with a splash of rum in a cute little tea cup with a saucer!

Among the group we ordered; bangers and mash (came out cold and we sent it back), the liverpool wings (which the guys said were good and they looved the new castle sauce), the burger, the pulled chicken sandwich, fish and chips and a few orders of fries.  So we basically sampled most of the menu and the only items we as group really liked were the wings and fries.  I'm not sure if the restaurant is new and needs some practice or what the deal is but the food needs some work.    

I love the place for it's charm and character.  The service and the drinks were good!  Definitely don't come hungry like we did.  I would recommend coming for drinks only or nightcaps after your belly is full!  It's a great ambiance if you want to sit and enjoy a fire!","2011-10-27 15:25:22"

2 - strip steak. Ordered it medium rare. Next time I'm getting the NY steak bc it may be thicker.
3 - medium over eggs.  Next time I'll do well done.
My first time here so I need to adjust my order temp on eggs and meat next time.

Also, picked up a soup to go last second for only $1.50 chicken escarole was a nice surprise and great price.  Need to check out the dinners and try it a few times to see if they can be consistent with food, but for now was very pleased.

The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans, tin roofs, and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect.

I had the Goldpan chicken (I think that's right) which consisted of chicken in a sour cream based sauce with red onions and mixed with sauteed veggies, mashed potatoes and a large, buttermilk biscuit.

"rbL7HYmmpIzlPxCYF6i4VQ",4,"I visited the Gaylord Opryland hotel/resort/conglomerate a few weeks ago when I was visiting Nashville with my boyfriend. We stopped by to see the hotel, but didn't stay there as guests. This place wasn't really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you're flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) 

Parking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you're mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it's a nice walk.

The hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an ""outdoor"" feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by ""Delta River Boat Tours"" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the ""fascinating"" facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: ""Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN!"" (So old!) or, our favorite, ""Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND"" (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!) 

Anyway, it was hilarious. Seems like a nice place just to see/have a drink/ maybe dinner if prices aren't insane. Extra star for our tour guide who we still laugh about.","2009-05-23 19:18:06"

However the three stars are attributed to less than spectacular entrees that are slightly over priced (for Mexican food) and everyone in our group had drinks that were all consistently weak (i.e. tasted like less than an ounce of alcohol). I would give 3.5 stars if possible, but I see this as a second or third option in the Tampa area for Mexican cuisine.","2015-04-15 12:46:42"

I would/should be giving it 2 stars based on the food alone, however, the service was so good to warrant a full star on that alone- & I evaluate a place based not only on the food but on the entire experience.
So, the food: if you have it on the menu, you better have it in the kitchen. They were missing a few things which was very disapponting. We shared the scallops which were the best part of the meal- but for $3.33/scallop it better be good. I settled for the salman which was nothing special (salmon is usually a fail safe for me, I always get it if nothing else jumps out at me on the menu- so I've had a lot of salmon throughtout my life.) It was accompanied by heavily peppered carrots & green beans and a ""root puree"" which was just a fancy way of saying mashed potatoes.... which was a tease because I was expecting sweet potato, parsnips or SOMETHING better than a root vegetable I am already fully aware of. Drinks were decent: my bf had a bourbon/cherry martini & I had my favorite- a dry, dirty grey goose martini. Hard to mess those up , though. Desserts were a puffed pastry that lacked any real flavor & a coconut creme brulee that was actually quite good- but just like a baked potato- is pretty hard to mess up.

So when I finally got the chance to go to Yo Sushi I was so excited! It's located at Int'l Mall on the ground floor, in the middle of the mall by the escalators and Godiva. 

I went during lunch time with 3 people on a Tuesday around 1 pm and was promptly seated. 
I ordered about 6 plates, 4 from the conveyor and 2 from my waiter. 
The sushi was pretty good, portions are small for the price but still okay. 
I got this eggplant dish from the belt and it was so good! I love eggplant :)

The prices are determined by the color of the plates. The price came out to about $25 for everything, which wasn't bad considering getting 6 plates. The salmon sushi plates were my favorite, and the popcorn shrimp was so good. 

Only problem we had was one of the dishes my friend ordered (Tuna Tataki) took like 30 minutes to get to us. I don't know if they put it on the belt accidentally or what, but our waiter didn't seem too concerned about my friend waiting so long for what he ordered.

The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy. It was just the right amount of space and with all of the different room kept things interesting for our guests and allowed people to spread out across the different rooms and patios.

It is very eclectic with random decor and music.

The bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough.

I ordered the Big Jerk sandwich and the Caprese, but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich, which they had no problem doing. Both were good with the Caprese stealing the show.

The food:
The Big Jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender (pork). It was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce. The caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side. The pickle spear that came with it was not your standard ""dill spear"". It is homemade and very fresh, just lacking a little zest, but still good.
The caprese rocked. The balsamic reduction, cubes of Moz, diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination. I will definitely get that again but next time I will ask them to scale back on the size. Way more than I needed.

Now for the good stuff: The house beer, ""Phat Beer"". I'm not big on IPA's or local brews, but this one has won my heart. Somewhere twixt a Bud and Bud Light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue.

The only reason Phat's didn't get five stars was because of the Big Jerk. They need to freshen that up a little.

Footnote:
Phat's needs to upgrade/separate the restrooms. The women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind. They also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis.
They also definitely need to get an exhaust hood over the griddle.","2015-11-06 01:32:54"

"TKFiQGsovb89p7-ffcuPYg",1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE and INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES. I created a Yelp account just to write about how horrible the service is at this Cosi.

I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.

A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?

Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review, but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment.

What came out was a poorly reheated 4""X6"" square of a layer of macaroni topped with ground beef, 1"" of browned mashed potatoes.
What you don't see mashed potatoes in the description of the dish? You thought that the word ""layers"" meant more than one?  You thought that béchamel was a sauce?  You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.

When I asked the waiter, he said that those were not mashed potatoes, it was solid béchamel, that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by, offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes, just looked at me as if to say, you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.

By this time, I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes, and that béchamel was not a sauce.

Birds are very good at hiding their symptoms and can be stubborn patients. I have two and I wouldn't let anyone treat them besides Dr. Ehrlich. 

One of my little guys is getting up there in age and started having seizures and problems with his feet. My last vet thought the seizures were nothing to worry about, but Dr. Erlich knew better. She diagnosed him based on my description of his symptoms and a simple exam. She confirmed with a blood test that took only twenty minutes to return results.

Radnor Veterinary Hospital offered us a same-day appointment. Check-in was quick, and we were seen on time. Dr. Erlich spent a solid 30 minutes with us, explaining her diagnosis and her recommended treatment. She ran the test for us while we waited. And I do not feel I was overcharged for Radnor's services. 

My primary care doctor will only see me same-day if I'm having an emergency. After arriving on time at her office, I usually wait 30-60 minutes before I'm taken to an exam room.

We can always tell when she's comfortable at the facility because she will go right back without a problem which is definitely what she does at Holiday house! She always comes home tired and freshly clean with a beautiful coat. In addition, which tops off this review, is the fact that I had to board my sweet girl in a rush due to being in early labor with my daughter. I called Holiday House that after noon, they not only had a room for her but they offered to have someone come pick her up for me at my home so that I didn't have to drive her. That, to me, is quality service! I only wish they had cameras so that I could see her while we are away.","2016-06-22 20:46:05"

The hotel is overall very good, but most impressive were the beds... they're comfortable! Most hotels cheap out & buy hard (uncomfortable) beds because they last longer, but Drury's were great and we slept really well.

The location is good for the value, and the hotel is very accessible.

Bathrooms were very clean, and had LOTS of water... more water out of a shower head than I can remember at any hotel ever (usually it's just a trickle).

Free breakfast and snacky dinner were good, though only an idiot would stay in NOLA and fill up on free hotel hot dogs.

The only negative is the loud hall & door latches. All night long you hear other rooms' doors going KA-CHUNK.

Free WiFi is nice... amazing that some hotels still charge for this.

After the Royal Sonesta, this is my new favorite NOLA hotel (and it costs 1/2 as much).","2012-04-29 12:04:26"
"zj212mBMgYXhxS0srtlPew",4,"I'd heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.

It's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.

 Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.
The donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.

The Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.

The caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I""d imagined.

The pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.

The halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.

Believe the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.","2012-03-01 02:07:58"

The Costco employee felt bad and even offered to partially reimburse me for something that broke when they were trying to fix my tire (I turned them down but it's the thought that counts!). I will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me!

Saturdays and Sundays are the days my boyfriend and I like to shop here because of all the delicious samples. The employees are all helpful, cheerful, and respectful. Place is clean, you'll find bargains, and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere. Some of the generic Costco (Kirkland signature) items are just as good if not better than brand names.

Best of all, I hear you don't even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices. $1.50 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills? $10 for a delicious WHOLE 18"" pizza? Too good to be true and yet it is!

With competitive prices, gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy, and membership perks, such as travel getaway packages, I found I have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon.

"OojEenwgCcEqGL8T7b0j5Q",4,"They lose a star for having TWO STORES on essentially the same road...one on the far northeast side and one on the far northwest side. Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all. 

However, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze. 

Kefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores. 

I am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga. 

Trader Joe's is a great place to find food to ""cheat"" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all. 

In conclusion, start writing letters, people! We need a downtown Trader Joe's! It isn't fair that so many of us (including students, who want nothing more than to eat healthy) have to drive 30 minutes each way to get groceries!","2013-11-14 20:45:33"

"g3zaUmCDGQVOQoj-7tCNTQ",2,"After a bad storm temporarily shut down our new-to-us favorite coffee shop Pagoda, I decided to give this spot a try.  Won't be back.  Here's why...

Location:
Look, parking in town can be difficult.  That is no different here.  I found a spot nearby but I've talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here.  Just luck of the draw.  Beautiful gardens and homes to look at (duh) so just enjoy the stroll.  I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.

Atmosphere:
Dead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.

When I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.

Not the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. 

After I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?

Service:
I asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.

Coffee:
It was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.

I couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.

Other:
I didn't eat so no word on that.

Bathrooms were clean enough.

Great restaurants nearby.

I really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.","2017-05-13 14:22:33"

I came in with my brother and said I would co-sign a lease for him when they came back with numbers inflated 3 times what the Hyundai site advertises. We walked off the lot. They kept calling my brother telling him to come in they would do the deal at that advertised price. UNBEKNOWNST to me they ran the entire lease under my social without my permission and told me as after the paperwork was signed. SCUM BAGS. I called the next day to complain and they blew me off for two weeks straight with excuse until the tags were released

 DON""T GO HERE. they are DIRTY. We own a car dealership and I happen to know tags do not drop 36 hours after being tricked into signing a lease contract on my good credit when it was supposed to go in the other persons name.

It was a great ride to have over the holidays as we visited family in varying parts of the northeast.  However, we misread our original contract and ended up getting charged for something that totally caught us off-guard.  It honestly would have been a major blow to our holiday joy had it not been for the manager & customer service rep on location in PHL on duty on 12/30/2012.  They could see that we were desparate and genuinely unaware of the charges and they helped us to pay what we thought we had originally agreed to.  It reinstated my faith in humanity.  But then as we walked out the shuttle bus to the airport had just pulled away... we thought we'd be stuck waiting for another 20 minutes and every minute counts at the airport.

Don't be like impatient me who bites into molten takoyaki, disregarding all warnings and good sense! I knew better, but I do these things constantly with pizza slices, and with delicious Japanese street food snacks, evidently.

I am a fan of Maru's savory ping pong-ball-sized pancakes, filled with pickled red ginger, scallions and octopus. Takoyaki, handmade while you wait, eight of them are served up nice and hot... A golden steamin plate of takoyaki, covered in shavings of dried bonito, nori, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce. It's a really great snack, and you know I love a little nosh to share ""on the way"" here or there. I need incentives and rewards for everything. The spicy octopus variety with a little shichimi mayo fits the bill quite nicely.

Also, after peering at the Maru ball cooking process, I am sure that I now really want a nice cast iron takoyaki pan for my very own, to add to my stockpile of kitchen paraphernalia. In addition, just want to note that I love Maru Global's red lanterns with the cute octopus fella on em... My house needs some of those too, because I can't stop hanging decorations from my ceiling.

However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can't help but make this personal and say that I wasn't treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, ""Who let you in?"" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies.

Service has varied from so-so to good---but usually toward the ""good"" end of the scale---and the speed has been from slow to super-fast.

What I really like is the pool area. The pool and spa are just wonderful. Peppermill has a large heated pool area designed for play. The lower pool seems to be the family pool with an older crowd on the upper deck. There is a bar and drink service poolside, perfect for all day lounging.

When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room, the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.

After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.

I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!

Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.

Next, the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.

When we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.

I think their sauce overpowers the taste of the toppings and cheese - could barely taste the pepperoni.  Light sauce would be my recommendation to others.

On this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... 

I ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.

Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.

The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.

We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.

"rzrBiijeQh7ubjfRCr-UtA",4,"A very upscale and respected chain, with a short list of cities to allure with their prime cuts of meat and their fresh seafood. Philly is lucky to be one of those three cities! 

The bar melds perfectly inside the restaurant and does not make you feel like it is the ""bar"" area. Tables fill this room for dining or having a cocktail. One step up and to the side is an elevated floor, where we sat.  Beyond the ""bar"" area that you walk into, is a more secluded dining area, but we were center stage and had a great view of it all. 

Hubby and I ordered and shared three appetizers. We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. 

My husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. 

The restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. 

What I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight. The waiters were professional, but with charisma and humor and knew how and when to have conversation. 

Bottom line, I would go back in a heartbeat!

Wheelchair accessible with ramp through main entrance into the lobby of the hotel and entrance right in through their door.","2008-04-30 15:26:12"

The lobster roll dint disappoint, though I'd like to try other menu items, as well. My son thoroughly enjoyed his lobster roll, too, so again, it was money well spent to see him pleased! The restaurant itself is a little short on space and ambiance. When we were there, they were slammed all at once, but the owner stepped in, apologized, got us seated, and took our order. He was humorous and kind, which took the edge off. I will visit again and this time, I'll try the steamed shrimp or crab legs... GIVE IT A TRY, ITZ WORTH IT!","2014-10-27 03:22:06"

"K4Mh2epWTFUZZfb-DtCpHg",1,"Arrived at 6:55 for a 7pm reservation for 8.  Waited at the host station for 10 mins while servers walked back and forth ignoring our group.  Eventually we were seated at a BBQ table with 2 grills and provided with menus, then the server (who looked miserable to be there) vanished for 20 minutes.  When he returned we were more than ready and began to order only to be advised that the BBQ grills at our table didn't work.!  Wouldn't it have been nice to tell us this when we were seated?  Since 90% of the menu items are BBQ, and that's the reason we came to this restaurant instead of the other local Korean restaurants, we asked to move to a BBQ table that worked.  We waited 15 more minutes and were seated at another table with one grill and placed the order, 7:45 at this point.  All the food came out but many of us  waited eagerly for food since they are grilling for 8 people on one small grill.  Finally everyone is served but then we sit for 20 more minutes waiting for someone to check back, offer boxes or the check.  They actually didn't ever come until one of us got up and requested it and it still took a while.  All in all a disaster of a night and will never go back.  I'd rather skip the BBQ and choose one of the many other excellent Korean restaurants in the area then sit through that again.","2017-01-15 03:17:23"
"0-3vo5stsbJZojuGSUxbBQ",5,"This was legit and lives up to the hype. My friends and I shared the Thai sensation (Thai iced tea and lychee) which was perfect. The Thai ice tea ice cream wasn't too sweet and lychee fruit was used so the mix of the small bits into the ice cream worked out well.

3 toppings with a syrup is included for 7 dollars with tax. For the novelty and show while they prepare your treat, I think the price is very reasonable. The toppings I got were mochi, strawberry, pocky sticks and condensed milk. I think the picture will speak for itself. 

They opened 2 months ago and they will have no trouble attracting attention. As a tourist to the area, I was glad to stumble upon this location. Great spot to hang out, bring a date or just get some solid ice cream. 

Important to mention, this ice cream will not be creamy. Common sense, how can something that is prepared and rolled in this manner be creamy like say gelato. If you come in with a realistic expectation, you'll have a better experience. This won't be the best ice cream you'll ever have, but the appearance and novelty makes it worth trying.","2016-09-06 01:09:02"

We had two homes outside of Tucson that were left in questionable condition after a bad contractor had his way with them and needed a reputable licensed electrician to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. Bonnie understood our situation as we already had a buyer for the home, ready to move in and needed to address any potential issues ASAP. She sent us Anthony, a wonderful guy who really knows his stuff. He did a thorough job of reviewing the entire service, including the breaker boxes, lines throughout each structure as well as the outlets and switches.

It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked, reusing the same dirty spoons to taste, stir, and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty, but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again.

"4WKhODPw_tQwjw_BiXz-gg",4,"I must admit when we saw the place totally empty on Sun at 6PM, I was concerned.
We ordered the combos to get a taste of various items.
Food was plated quickly and served with a complimentary beer.
I have to say that for the most part, each item was really excellent. I will elaborate.

Brisket was absolutely perfect! Tons of flavor, super tender, some fat (but that is not only expected, it is desired) The BEST!

Ribs were also super moist, and very flavorful. I read that some reviewers had dry ribs. These were seriously excellent. There were so many BBQ sauces to try too. I have to say that there was little need to put sauce on it... yes, that good.

Pulled pork was great, a tad too salty, but by no means unpleasant like another reviewer stated. Very moist, great flavor

The chicken was a pulled chicken. I guess I should have been clearer and asked for BBQ chicken. The pulled chicken was good, but also a little over salted. It seemed to be white meat that was shredded.

They DO have collards (not on menu). And they were very good

The spinach was a bit better in my opinion as they had a generous amount of garlic and olive oil (very Italian) 

Garlic mashed were very good, Cole Slaw was also very good.

Now that we tasted most of the menu, the standouts for me were the brisket, ribs, and spinach.

Another reviewer was disturbed by the Italian language TV channel. Seriously?  get over it!
The owner/chef is Italian and speaks the language. This also explains why they also have pizza. I cant wait to try the pizza next time.

We both loved this place and can't wait to return, however weight is an issue.... so wait we will.","2015-12-21 03:53:40"
"ePhCWKZxWWsPCDM-BNaW8A",4,"I frequent the Rittenhouse Square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street, and have passed Porcini's many times. Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. 
The layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.
The food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means ""before"" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. 
For our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. 
Our main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. 
We did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. 
Overall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!","2012-12-04 13:38:42"

"2R8oDw3hQBt2whHm_jczSQ",1,"My fiancé and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food, service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.

Issues:
1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!  
2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA.
4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished!
5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!  
6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.  

All in all food was good, not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else.","2014-04-19 16:20:34"

"9lXH6vIXS_-1NuHWx_d_bw",4,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for Lee House's latest restaurant to open up shop. Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.

Anyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.

While we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.

We ordered:
- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.
- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. 
- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.
- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. 
- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.
- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.

So to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back.

I'm a coffee snob - Peet's in the Bay Area, Intelligencia in Chicago, Dunn Bros. etc.. and the coffee here was pretty good - just a shade lighter roast than Peets.  

I also picked up some Amaretti cookies to share but once I tried them decided to keep them

They have plenty of delicious deli and bakery items available but you generally can't see either case over crowds while you wait, and if you don't know your order immediately when your numbers called you are S.O.L! They will very quickly call the next person in line so my advice would be to arrive the second they open so that you actually stand a chance of seeing the cases.

It's a great place for extroverts, but it's very small and very very full of people, so if you're the type of person who is not into that sort of thing, I would probably try to go in the most non-peak hours you can.","2016-04-23 13:29:52"

I really don't think the area is all that bad, so I don't know if it is just fear that keeps people from frequenting here or what. It could soon be because of lack of stores, several have closed shop within the last year. 

They have I'd say a 50/50 split in stores like New York & Company to get work clothes and urban stores. As far as I know right now, they still have a Victoria's Secret and Waldenbooks, what more could a dorky girl want in a mall right? Because of the low attendance you'll have no problem finding sales.

My son (he's eight but eats like a teen) ordered the meat plus two veggies kids plate. He said the green beans were the best he's had and loved the pulled pork without and sauce.

I ordered the jalapeno burger, and it was just smothered in sauce, overpowering everything.  We ordered all of the appetizers to share with our guests, and the tuna devlied eggs was the best thing I ate.

My wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  

For starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.  

I woke up the next day, thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.  Hands down, this is ONE of the best burgers I have eaten!","2012-03-01 04:59:48"

I haven't eaten at an Italian restaurant this good in a long time. The food was outstanding. My family is big eaters, and we did WORK! Let's start with the appetizers. I had the Calamari Fritti, which was amazing. I am a big fan of dipping sauces and loved that it came with three! I tried some of the others which were the Ariancini, clams, and mussels. All of which were equally good, especially the mussels. Next we split up a chicken ala vodka pizza. It was crisp and tasty. I got a chicken tortellini soup next. It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.
I can't write this review and not mention how phenomenal the service was. We had an 8:15 reservation and were greeted by the hostess and told our table would be a few minutes. She was very kind. While we were waiting the manager came up to us, offered us drinks, and told us the next available table was ours. It was nice knowing that they cared we were waiting. After a few minutes we were seated. Our waiter was GREAT. He was very professional, told us about the specials, didn't need to write anything down, and kept our drinks full the whole meal. What more could you ask for in a waiter?

I asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what... it was free! score!

The adobo goat cheese nachos are a must try! I also recommend the black bean soup, the mediterranean sampler, the blue corn asparagus tacos, and the falafel wrap.

"akg2wAOvCIjOsYGn-VUsJg",3,"Three stars is pretty much on the money. I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. 

So we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. 

I was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT ""Call Me Maybe"" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. 

Since I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like ""oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another"" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.

For that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. 

I wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.

The quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. 

Even though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not. In my case it's really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if I were asked to come again, I wouldn't say no.","2013-12-29 03:31:08"

Unfortunately not everyone has the ability to pick up on the difference that fresh and quality ingredients make in any meal... Yes even a hotdog.

I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry/Cake/Sweets stuff kind of place. ""BITTERSWEET confections"" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of ""THE SPOTS"", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets. I was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts I've been having these kids are in for a real TREAT!!

"9O3jAxvSbslAyoAcMzIwMA",5,"I have to say that I was really impressed with this place. I had heard about it here on Yelp and decided I should try it. I ordered the ranch fried chicken and the indian cinnamon donut and both were very good. I also had what I would call their plain donut and it was delicious. The donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was tender and moist and also delicious.
The only downside to this place is the size. The restaurant is very small and there is very little seating. The seating is diner style, stools at a counter. This would be a great place for takeout, which they do.

Overall I would definitely recommend going here. I would also recommend going early as they tend to sell out fairly quickly in the mornings.","2012-03-01 16:05:12"

"n0WsV9wThDGmXjyOulhSag",2,"We discovered this place on our GPS at the last minute so I didn't have time to yelp it since my phone doesn't have the app for it. Anyways, this place is inside a nice place on the pier to where there are lots of tourist shops and other restaurants and a small aquarium. We came here on Cinco De Mayo. So because of that, the margaritas were half off that day, woo hoo!!! 

I forgot it was Cinco De Mayo and when I asked the waitress how much the margarita was, she looked at me funny for some reason. She kept on looking at me funny the whole time I asked her anything. The rest of the time she tried to ignore me for no particular reason. WTH? 

On the bright side, the margaritas were huge and blended just the way I like it. They had lots of good flavors to choose from like pineapple, banana, strawberry, mango, and a few other fruity flavors. At the time we were there, only one other table was occupied. I got the fried grouper sandwich which is a popular fish in FL. It was just OK. The service was slow and the waitress was weird. She asked my husband if he'd like more water a few times but ignored me completely. I don't know why she was giving me an attitude as I wasn't rude to her at all. 

Whatever, mean woman haters like her suck. The grouper sandwich was $9.95. Fries didn't come with the sandwich and cost an additional $1.65. What a rip off! Fries should come with a full meal IMHO. The margaritas were $4.00 each. The soup of the day that my husband got was $5.95 for a large bowl. And the key lime pie which tasted like lime cheesecake cost $5.95. The inside of the place is cute and there is an outdoor patio that faces the beach. Also, there is a bar outside. If you decide to eat here, don't order the grouper sandwich, it sucked and was dry but since I was hungry, I ate it. The margaritas were good though.","2010-05-15 06:15:16"

"T9cG8cFDaQaEKyUqKDW2cQ",4,"The overall decor of the Peppermill Casinos is an absolute assault on the senses that takes you back to the late 80's, but if you can get past that, this place is pretty decent.

We had a room in the Tuscany Tower which, even though the decor in this area and in the room was casino-ey over-the-top to pretend to be somewhere in Italy, if they'd revamp the rest of the property to have this look, it'd be a massive improvement, but I realize some people like funky neon space rainbow decor. 

Our room was very large with a huge bathroom with a shower and large whirlpool tub. The room had a tv in the bathroom and in the bedroom with the usual limited cable lineups. The bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds I've had and we slept very well. The lighting in the room uses expensive dimmer switches and there are a lot of them! It was definitely overkill for a hotel room, but its nice to see that level of effort. Lots of big, dark crown molding and big Italian-looking paintings.

"R4Ge73DbnSSP18Y9ZCGnjA",3,"Two years ago Florida Georgia Line came to town right around my birthday. Radio, TV and all over social media, all I saw was the concert. I figured it was impossible to not know about it, and I also figured my wife would be taking us to see the show for my birthday surprise. Sadly, I was wrong, and the show came and went, leaving me waiting for another opportunity to catch these guys live.

Finally, that day came, and I took matters into my own hands this time! I scored a pre-sale code and bought two great seats, only to find out my wife would be out of town the night of the show. Lucky for me I had a great friend decide to join me for the show, and what a show it was! 

In addition to the sweet sounds of Cadillac 3 and Cole Swindell, who played all the hits, Florida Georgia Line brought the energy, the stage game, and every one of the songs you wanted to hear. But the best part had to be the two incredible surprises! In the second half of the show they walked down a catwalk to a second stage at the rear of the auditorium and played a set with Cole Swindell and Cadillac 3, including some homages to their country mentors, like ""Back At Mama's"" by Tim McGraw! This was trumped only by the encore, when they talked about the songs they identified with as kids and then performed them! Songs like Montell Jordan's ""This is how we do it"", Backstreet Boys ""Everybody"", Alan Jackson's ""Should Been A Cowboy"" and Papa Roach ""Last Resort"", and then they closed it all up with ""Cruise"".

3 Stars because of the insanely long wait for a bar. I think that's a shame. It's an event center. They should know how to do this by now.

"KJKPBNwoPNWdUA2qQBJQdw",5,"As a scared mom of one who was told that the birth I desired is ""archaic"" (by my doctor) I felt hopeless. I thought my only solution this go round was to repeat the same overly medicated birth I experienced last time where they told me what to do and I had no say in the matter. I found Rebecca via the web and she came so highly recommended I had to at least speak to her. Her flexibility made me instantly fall in love. She met me via Skype (my request) and was so sweet and knowledgeable I knew she was the doula for me (despite the many others I'd interviewed). From that moment on I've been soaking up her knowledge and leaning on her for support. When I went into labor and couldn't even open my eyes her voice made me so calm Bc she created such a safe soothing space for me, ensuring whispered voices and dimmed lights. She was able to bestow more knowledge on us in that setting than any of the nurses on staff. She is literally a genius when it comes to birth. She has so many tactics and means to provide the best support. She is still my go-to for any mommy concerns. She is always there and always reassuring. Gosh, I love her. She is very affordable and provides so much expertise that I truly don't know why she doesn't charge more. When I had to leave the state for a family emergency within weeks of my due date she found me not just a back-up doula, but also a hospital that does water births. She found me a medical practice that supported my birth choice here in Atlanta. Thanks to her educating me I was able to have the birth I always wanted and didn't know was possible. I am amazed that I did that but humbled Bc I know that I couldn't have done it without her.","2015-09-23 23:28:11"

"bEA-reYItGey3olxRI1CBg",5,"It was our last night in NOLA and I made dinner reservations for 7:30 pm. I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.

Our waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.

For dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries

What's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. 

We had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.

Redemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.","2013-05-07 13:54:08"

Today  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut. It would be so much better.

The only breakfast dish I haven't been thrilled about is the sausage biscuit with gravy. The reason is because it's a sausage patty on an amazing biscuit. I wish they just put fresh ground sausage in the gravy instead.

I was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best gluten-free bread and buns she has ever tasted. She said they were so good, that she ate six buns in a row. I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted. 

I've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too.

You can bring up to a LITER mug of your own and they will fill it for $5. The place is small but the atmosphere was fun.

The prices are reasonable. Their food is only okay though. I've had their sandwiches a few times. My biggest gripe is I do not like their tomatoes. I think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard. I could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less.

They also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it's hard to mess up a hot dog. They hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. Cheap and quick but so not worth it.

She let us roam the gallery and was available for any questions. We did not feel pressured to buy anything and once we realized that we were attracted to the work of Shahine, Debbie was there to help figure out what piece we were interested in seeing in a frame. Debbie inquired about our style, where the painting would go and the look we were trying to capture to showcase in our home?

After almost an hour in there, we decided to think about the piece we were looking at and Debbie put the painting on hold for us and offered to text us within 24 hours. We left, continued our holiday shopping and came back within the hour to make our purchase. Debbie was just as excited as we were about  making this purchase. ""Petit Bonhomme"" by Shahine is so beautiful and we cannot wait for it to be a  part of our collection. Debbie helped us pick out a beautiful frame and we felt confident about our purchase/investment.

We sat and waited, checking out their menu. The waitress/bartender came up and asked if we were ready to order, but since part of our party was missing, we asked if we could have a few minutes. Well, I guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us. The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu. We got margaritas all around. I had a mango margarita (I tried it both on the rocks and blended) and it was absolutely delicious! I would return just for their fabulous Mango margarita. I heard both their strawberry and traditional margaritas were just as good as well! (Just a tip, avoid the banana margarita!) It took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something. We didn't even think about ordering food, considering the service we were receiving wasn't ideal. The drinks were good and our waitress was polite, just not very attentive.

I got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn't need that much. 

The guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.

"hckjA9TzEJRDNIEpcRNVtA",5,"Walking up upon the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, you can't help to marvel at the beauty of the statues and facade. The classic Romanesque architecture is as compelling in size as its design. 

For my first symphony, I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience. 

During the first piece, I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.

The acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage, we noticed that the balcony's were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.

Walking around the outside gardens, you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility. 

Its without saying, you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece/song/tune. However, I do know that the experience rivaled nearly every concert I have attend. And I have: There are many shows under my belt.

"Nw12uOGcA_cf8IEB053nyw",3,"I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost.  I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  

The Good:
I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   

The Not So Good:
The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?

If you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.","2017-01-14 22:41:59"

"1WFRWOUQjfl0R2eH6veBnQ",1,"I wish I could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant... On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently, my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd, but I added ""medium please"".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.  A full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared.  My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway,  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd, since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving, I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since ""you ate the burger part""... with no apology or attempt at customer service.

Sadly the hour wait was the typical story of the night for anyone that stopped here during GMX. The place did not seem that busy as far as restaurants go, so maybe they're not used to the traffic. 

The salad was not worth $15. If I hadn't gotten it with chicken I would have been sorely disappointed, though it was sad even with the $5 chicken finger on it. 

The food is cooked in the restaurant, but the server has to walk out of the restaurant and across the hall to the bar to get your drinks (at least alcoholic ones). The same goes for the bar: the food comes from the restaurant across the hall.","2015-11-06 05:25:30"

"S-IwFgSGRkGEG8U89K7f4A",1,"I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life.

 We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first, their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings, spicy sauce, and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually, however, they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.

Last weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's, but we paid ~$15 each.

"7lEnBPyy-oeKK9eIucCtqw",1,"This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali, who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping, stopping by the front desk and activating the green ""make up room"" button -- behaved as though making the bed, cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service, i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.   

No one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question. 

The binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder. 

The binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside, and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air, since there are no balconies or windows that open. 

There was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to, they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green ""make up room"" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made, but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door, à call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced, that's just bad management. 


Post script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work, as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable.

The jambalaya was really flavorful with just the right amount of heat, but very short on andouille and chicken. It had no shrimp in it at all. 

'Real Creole Shrimp Tacos' were more like real creole lettuce tacos. Maybe we should have known because the sample did not have a lot of shrimp so we ordered at our own risk. Flavorful sauce and tasty tortillas though.","2015-06-08 17:09:21"

If you've been to Aidan Gil in the last 7 years, chances are you got your hair cut by one of these barbers.

This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it, it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with, was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone, it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place, be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza.","2014-01-17 00:29:15"

Sadly the kitchen was slow.  We were the last table of the night and our mains took an hour to get to our table.  I ordered the pirogies (which have changed from a month or two back).  They were fairly cold, the side vegetables weren't cooked well and it was rather ho hum.

To drink I ordered a drink I had before, the Gin Gin Mule...I think they used tonic water instead of the ginger beer.

"CvzDQD1sxKDBODo0o8HU3g",3,"I have been to this nail salon a few times over the past 3 mos. Their quality and service is slipping. This is too bad because I go here because it is so close to my work and easy for me to pop in on my way home. 

It is still clean, friendly service, etc. No complaints there. But the quality of service is not as good. They are not as thorough and services have been rushed and sloppy. 

One complaint is there is only one employee who does nails (other than manis) and this is a huge time suck. 

Another is that my last pedi was rushed and not up to par. The woman did not trim the cuticles as well, remove dead skin, pay attention to detail, or do a thorough job. She went very fast and cut corners.

I got a full set, and a pedi. The man did the nails (which were fine/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality. 

I happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well. There are many designs you can choose from on the hand models/boards but they are not recreated well. I chose one design for my big toes and it looked nothing like what I picked out. On an earlier visit, I had a picture of a design on my phone and was told point blank they couldn't do it - it was not complicated or too fancy. ??? I have witnessed other customers being disappointed in the nail art feature as well. 

Overall, I think this place may be understaffed to meet demand and is struggling with consistent quality. They need another person who can do nails really well like the man does and they need to take their time/provide thorough service.","2014-02-24 18:04:58"

Came and refilled out chips once, cleared plates in good time as we were done, and just overall really nice. Again, didn't feel rushed at all which was prefect because we were watching the phillies game so stayed awhile after our meal. One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for, completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something, not just a graham cracker thrown on top. So that's my only negative part about this place. 

Fried pickle chips, delicious! Make sure you let them cool, they taste so much better when they're not burning hot.","2009-10-16 18:34:01"
"J9a99Xm4MLivV7ZXOv4ISg",3,"I have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night. Simply, the beer is just ok. I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.

P.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.","2014-11-30 23:53:06"

The scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.

The tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)

The popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad.

So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid.

I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch.

"M_e2rr02aJ76nAg6uboC0g",3,"This is a struggle on this one. The interior is amazing it's 5 star cozy lodge feel with nice fireplace. So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.

The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.

The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  

The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.

I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.

Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.

PS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.

After some discussion, I decided to go with some pork chops, which had to be cut.  No problem, the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking.  And man, were they some of the best pork chops we've ever had.

I had such a great experience that I went back 2 days later, this time with my husband, a lover of all things meaty.  We were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff.  The experience you will have at Cappuccio's is worth the trip alone, but their meats are also exceptional.  I think we've found our local butcher shop.","2014-07-13 16:34:49"

As you walk in and approach the counter you can see the different protein choices, salsas, rice, etc.  I decided to go with a burrito with white lime-cilantro rice, black beans, steak, pico de gallo, and cheese.  The burrito was massive, and was less than 7 dollars!  Ingredients all tasted fresh, very refreshing.  I honestly can't wait to go again!  My only complaint is that the chips we shared were stale, and horribly over salted.  4 stars.","2013-06-24 07:38:03"
"gmU_Sjxv-8CsE73VCz2tjw",2,"This review is for the racquetball courts only. 

I only give two stars because upkeep is needed on these courts. I've been twice and there was so much grit  and unevenness on the floor from cracks that I was afraid of rolling my ankle and doing serious damage to myself. In a sport like racquetball you really need at least a level court that you won't slip and slide on. I also noticed a lot of trash in them too, like a pregnancy test. For such a nice park as Francis is, I expected better.

If you live on the Hill or South Hampton area, go to Tilles Park first for Racquetball, that's my number two spot for RB behind Forest Park.","2010-07-08 02:01:26"

There were only 3 other tables there when we came in but it filled up throughout the hour & a half we were there. I would suggest making a reservation as there are only about 12 tables total - & it's BYO so bring your own wine. 

I forget the actual name of the appetizer we got but it was basically fried risotto with mozzarella & marinara. It came out as 3 decent sized fried balls. They were delicious. I got the filet - which I asked to be cooked medium... it came out more on the medium-well side but it was fine. It's an Italian place... I should have known better :) BUT, the sauce & jumbo lump crab meat & mushrooms on top of the filet was amazing. It was served with sliced potatoes & green beans. My bf got the gnocchi & it was served in a butternut squash sauce... so good. I almost wish I would have gotten the gnocchi because they were pillowy & delicious. I'd definitely come back for those alone. We also got a side of homemade pasta with marinara sauce. It was good but I've had better homemade pasta at some other places. 

I have to admit, I expected to be there awhile since all the food is made to order but we were in and out within an hour & a half. We'll definitely be back.","2015-01-18 21:42:26"

There was salad, yellow rice, chicken and beef kabob, and shawarma. 

The Greek salad was amazing. Light dressing and full of fresh ingredients. And a great amount of feta cheese! Which was perfect for me because I love feta cheese.

However, like *many* other reviewers here, the service is awful. Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.

I brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, ""No"". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.

Then, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed ""Can I hep you with something?"", to which I responded, ""oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi."" The barista responded, ""We have a sign, for you,"" again with a plethora of shade.

Spot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.

The people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.

I went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. 

We ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.

Spot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch. Spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city. I will be back and probably soon. 4 plus Yelps.","2016-03-07 05:08:39"

The crowd was light in the early hours but it sure got crowded around 11pm. Bar service was decent and I didn't have to wait too long to get a drink. My only complaint is that the new DJ doesn't count in the songs which leads to chaos on the dance floor as many people don't know when to start the line dance correctly. This lead to me getting stepped on quite a few times (which is not fun when people are wearing cowboy boots and think they know how to line dance). Hopefully they will get the DJ to start counting in the songs!","2013-06-24 16:06:22"

"W8Bbih3S2nX_FmRv5u8cdA",5,"Reading the other reviews, I would have to agree that if one wants to 'wander through' a voo doo shop in New Orleans, this is the place to go.  But if one is actually seeking to embrace the art, it is even better than a shop, it is a spiritual mecca.  The people here are not the stereotypical 'scary' folks from television and film, they are lovely, genuine people whose practice is founded in a belief centered around helping others.  Without being an expert in the field, I can say that they counsel and practice from the best of places.  And the charms they made for my new office worked! (They are the first to tell you that any juju for success must be coupled with effort and skill, but just the same, we've been remarkably successful early on, and I know their blessings were in part responsible).

"duYGqetGMtGEwYKQnHDXGQ",4,"I have read the reviews of other past raters, and am sorry for their past experience.  I on the other hand have had much help and felt welcome.  I have been going to this library every day for the past year.  Why?

I am a school bus driver, from the Randolph County area.  I drive 20 minutes from my house to the bus yard, then pick up a student (Special Ed), and drive this student to a special school in the Belleville area.

Because of the low pay and long distance drive, I made arrangements with my boss, who is also the owner of the bus company, that I can stay up there, that the Library is only 2 miles from the school, and I would have plenty to keep me occupied.

Since it would also save him fuel/maintenance costs (making 1 trip as opposed to 2 trips), he allowed me to do that.  They have been good to me.  Yes sometimes it gets a little loud, and it has become a 2nd home for the less fortunate, but it has many great reference materials.

It is an old building, but I view the architecture as a work of art.  The second floor has a huge ceiling, with giant windows.  It is nice and open.  Thier reference section has shrunk down as they are re-arranging thier book set-up.

They have undergone renovations, and changed thier computer policy.  Now visitors can get 3, 30 minute sessions online.  The computer system is now linked up to all of southern IL, from Cairo to Effingham. 

If you have a library card anywhere in the southern part of the state, even if you have a Carbondale, or Mt Vernon card, it is now good for checking any book out there.  You can also access the Online Catalog system, and access your library account, and even place items on order yourself, and the staff will even show you how to do that if you ask them.

I am writing this review upon my final visits, due to, as I will be driving to a different school starting next week, in a different area of the Metro East.  They all knew what I did as a bus driver and was supportive of my being there as well.

So I have had good experiences overall, and rate the place about a 4, because it is in a building of Historical Significance, the computer access policy, an awesome microfilm (of Belleville News Democrat - Back to 1930s) collection, and a great children's section as well.","2013-10-24 14:57:11"
"l98-W_a2-2YESGRxE9dzvw",3,"Second time to visit Mazarin in three years.  Three years ago it was great, including the breakfast.  

But this last visit, Dec 2016, not too good.  I never got an answer to three phone calls previous to the visit.  (Three different days and three different times of day) So, I emailed to request courtyard view.  My Superior bedroom was facing the courtyard but it did not view the courtyard.  I was put on the third floor which viewed  the top of a tarp that covered the courtyard during inclement weather.  Only the weather was not inclement ... I suppose they were too tired to remove tarp.  They are very busy. (Never got answer to email either)

We booked the room for two people and had to request two wash clothes each day since there were none.

The concierge never looked up from her PC to welcome guests and it would look better if she would smile. (She probably wasn't feeling well)

Doorman was great and the desk service was prompt.

The breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this price point.  It seemed cooked hours previously, then placed on steam trays.  Similar to what is served in La Quinta.  Eggs were scrambled and stiff, bacon was limp and chewy and all the breads were stale and cold.  Juice and coffee were fine.  We stayed three days but only ate breakfast there the first.  Even though breakfast cost was included in the room cost.

Hint to cooks: If you keep scrambled eggs on steam trays they continue to cook and become over done.  Also breads, bagels and croissants are baked fresh daily in the Quarter.  It would be good to serve it.

On the better side the rooms were very clean and when the drain in the shower was slow, leaving us standing in an inch of water, they sent maintenance man right away and repaired it.  Slept well every night

I am sorry but we will not be staying a third time and cannot recommend this hotel as a 4 or 5 star hotel.","2016-12-19 16:20:07"

"l2tGR2l5EDfJrUTvHY9AFQ",4,"I usually wait a few months before giving a new restaurant a try because every new kitchen needs to ""shake out"" serving and cooking problems. I made an exception with Something Grilled because I am a huge barbecue fan. This used to be a takeout only place in Honey Brook, and they have moved to Exton and opened their first restaurant. Getting to know a new market, and adapting to new staffing issues takes time. Having eaten takeout from here once, and eaten in once, here are my first impressions...  

My takeout order was a rack of ribs with three sides and cornbread. The ribs were dry-rubbed and finished with a sweet Memphis style sauce with no ""heat."" The ribs are baby-back, not regular pork ribs, and for baby-backs were quite meaty and done nicely. They did NOT ""fall off the bone,"" and had just the right amount of ""tooth"" necessary for good ribs. The sides were summer slaw, which was spectacular; competent potato salad, which was potato,milk, butter, and pickle relish style; and mac and cheese, which was suitably creamy and a little stringy with mild white cheddar. The mac and cheese would have benefited from sharp cheddar and a little cayenne; it was pretty bland.

When I stopped by for lunch, I ordered the Carolina pulled pork barbecue sandwich with a side of ranch fries well done. Service was swift, but it was well after the lunch rush. I ordered ice tea, which was brewed (a good sign), and was given a basket of corn muffins and honey-cinnamon butter. The fries were well done as requested, and the sandwich was excellent -- stacked high with pulled pork with a light vinegar sauce and topped with summer slaw. The twist is that they bake a slice of mild white cheddar onto the bottom of the top bun. You barely notice it, but it does help hold the slaw onto the sandwich, otherwise a frequent failing with Carolina 'cue. 

It's pretty easy to criticize a new restaurant. This one is worth giving a little time to shake out any difficulties.","2013-12-07 00:32:13"

"lUFQ5z4DTAGLXyZy1085uQ",5,"STB is our absolute favorite restaurant in the Nashville area.  The menu is not traditional Korean, but a very unique take that produces wonderful results.  Some of our favorites are the Bi Bim Bop, the Spicy Pork Bulgogi, and all of the Korean Tacos, which come with fantastic, unique sauces.  Their rice bowls are also quite good, including curry, spicy, Hawaiian, and traditional styles.

Beyond good taste, the quality of the ingredients is top-notch.  The beef, pork, and chicken are always tender and perfectly done.  The owners take pride in using the freshest, healthiest, ingredients even if it costs them a little more.

Speaking of the owners, they are wonderful and welcoming.  They also do a great job of hiring friendly, smiling faces that make you feel good every time you walk in the restaurant.

The restaurant is small and modest inside, but well kept and clean.  The line at lunch can look long, but it moves quickly.  Parking is tight right in front of the restaurant, but the adjoining lot always has spaces.

I couldn't recommend STB any more highly.  If you enjoy any kind of Asian food, and go in with the understanding that it's not just a typical Korean place, you will have a great meal and a great experience.","2015-10-17 00:29:19"

Sadly, I was very disappointed. We arrived a little before 6pm on a Friday night and I wasn't sure if the place was open. There weren't many cars in the parking lot. I expected to at least see a crowd for happy hour. The place wasn't busy at all. The service was very good. Everyone was super nice. I have no complaints at all about the service. 

The food was nothing special. For an appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the Braised Meatballs (veal) and we both agreed that they were very good. I had the Pear Salad and I thought it was just ok. My boyfriend had the Eggplant parm, which he enjoyed. I tried a bite of his pasta just to sample the sauce. It wasn't bad. I had the Penne Pinoli and couldn't eat more than a few bites. The ingredients in both my salad and entree seemed of poor quality.

Now, however, she has caught up with demand (probably from the Vandy girls) and sells clothes and accessories from all over.  

I did try on a really cute knit halter dress, perfect for a beach cover up or just kicking around in the summer, but it was $50 and as I'm trying to save some money these days, figured I could buy something similar at Old Navy or Target.  Some cute dresses and knit shirts though.  There is also quite a selection of wraps, scarves, and various products from Mexico, South America, Indonesia, and other countries I'm sure.

We had plans to hop on the streetcar right across the street and check out the Garden District. It wasn't very busy at the time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was extremely friendly and told us to check out the specials they were offering. We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. 

We ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean. The home fries on the side were super amazing too, the seasoning on it was just enough and had the perfect crunch.

Back end was 2 stars, because entrees took very long and were unimpressive. Flavor was good but short on some ingredients. The veal special was just a breaded fried veal cutlet; no cheese, no sauce. Pappardelle with pork had almost no pork; tasted fine though. Chocolate hazelnut tort dessert took very long to expedite and preparation was inconsistent. We ordered 3 - there were 5 of us at the table - and one came with chocolate shavings, while 2 did not. One was also stuck to the plate and the crust was like stone.

"2d4VrxdDlJLOHGjO8ygtXw",5,"Salsa is absolutely terrible. Chips are great, but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. 


******************UPDATE***********************

So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him ""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.""

We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. 

To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. 

They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.

Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for ""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist"" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.","2017-03-15 01:54:12"

The food here is good but certainly not the best creole food around. I like the gumbo here it is delicious and not watered down like most of the other restaurants in this city. The crab cakes here were good too!

The service was satisfactory. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was not as bad as some of the other places I dealt with in the French Quarter. So I guess it was okay to say the least.

One of the other things I like about this place is the unusual amounts of homeless wino's that pass out in front of this place. I kind of understand that this is the norm on Bourbon street. But it is comical to see a bum passed out in front of an upscale place like this. This place is really pricey, but given the fact it is an upscale place on bourbon street I totally understand why.

In short good food, mediocre service, pricey establishment and a magnet for drunks to pass out in front of!","2013-12-28 22:25:55"

I gotta admit im embarrassed, I had been to this bar 4 times before I realized there was an outside patio.  That only made this place a 1000 times better.

I been here when it was a quiet night, maybe a little early and everyone (6 people) was at the inside bar watching Jackass2.5     I been here when it was so crowded , I wished everyone was a big fan of deodorant as I am.   Either way, everytime I came, I had a great time.

Im more of a beer drinker than anything so I cant comment on the mixed drinks but by the looks of it, they appeared to be pretty stiff.

The beer selection is decent too.  On tap is nice, Blue Moon, Magic Hat, Abitas to name a few.

The music they play when a DJ is in has varied greatly.  Walked in once and they were jamming to Reggae,  another time it was a Cure night and the most recent, we were bouncing along to some NOLA Clap.    I havent been here for a metal night, but im looking forward to it.

"NuJnV3-xYd6e3MonvALF6Q",3,"I'm going to make the bold statement and say that I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic. Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner. 

With that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the ""Bi-rite of the south"" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad. 

My main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.

What I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the ""Bi-Rite of the South"" in my book).

All in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)","2015-08-06 21:43:28"

I've had lunch here several times and never had a bad choice.  Today, I opted for the ""Homewrecker"":  a big, honkin' flour burrito crammed full of steak, black beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and pico de gallo (also available with pork, ground beef, chicken or tofu.)  All ingredients are fresh and packed with great flavor.

 - always a GREAT burrito...among the very best I've ever had!  (and filling, too!)  Also, their chips are made fresh and have a good flavor and crispness.  Finally, I like the choices of spicy and mild salsas.

Just two nits:

 - Salsa service.  I HATE having to fill three or four small containers to meet my needs.  I'd prefer to have a choice of a larger container.  Also, the area is too small to permit you to comfortably set your meal and drink down while dispensing without fear of being nudged by another or passing customer.  More elbow room in the salsa area would be great.

- Cleanliness.  It seems that the tail-end of the lunch hour gets greeted with a bit of a mess on the floors beneath the booths.  It would be great to have Moe be more mindful of cleaning underneath, as well as on top.  I'm not too crazy about tracking someone else's lunch back into my car!

"Jmc9s9V2SHV6jkYu311viA",5,"The Morning Cuban. It could be renamed ""Gout on a Plate,"" but HOLY $H!T is this open faced breakfast sandwich good. It comes on a thick slice of toasted bread (the type they use for french toast), with roasted pulled pork, swiss cheese, ham, 2 fried eggs on top, with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top, creating a moat of not-too-spicy green goodness. Holy sh!t. This makes me think of ""the morning after"" breakfast after partying in Miami's South Beach with some bangin Cuban honeys. Yes, it's like THAT. This sh!t is soooo bomb. I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.

Actually, even better than the ""normal"" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy, that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa. 

Oh, speaking of house, they were playing some nice jazzy/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection, or if it was just Pandora. 

Either way, big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.

Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied, saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket.

"oXuRc5x1FLLbLVs7vjxPSw",3,"Fun fact, I ""recently"" moved somewhat close to the ""Hill"". In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, ""Joey B's on the Hill."" Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.

Now, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.

Joey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]

After looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the ""regular"" half of the pizza.

Yes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.

Luckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.

The pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?

All in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.

Now that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.

Thin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.

Plus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.

Other menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.

So, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:

Food: A-
Atmosphere: B
Service: A
Price: $
Portion Size: Large

It truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends. I definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too. Let me know what you think when you go!

Happy eating!","2012-08-15 00:21:09"

My husband and I were craving ramen noodles for weeks and we went there hoping to get some tasty Ramen, little did we know that their food was unbelievably tasty.

I got the Brisket Ramen and my husband got the Lamb, they were both amazing but I highly recommend the Brisket.

I was pleased with a large bowl of vegetarian soup one night while I was sick and returned the next day for the Pumpkin Curry special (with tofu/veg).  The waiter remembered me and asked how I was feeling; a pleasant surprise as a transient in town for the work week.  Tea was served in an individual-sized teapot.

It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go.

"x2iZUNgzadKjnE-E7iccVA",3,"Sundial is a much improved downtown retail and restaurant complex that is righting many of the wrongs of the former Baywalk. The design is much more open and more conducive to bringing people to and through the center core.

Now that Locale Market has opened for business I expect the flow of people day and night will definitely increase. More traffic means more vitality.

Three restaurants on the second floor will be opening in 2015. Farm Table Kitchen which is the upstairs dining component to Locale Market. Ruth's Chris Steak House will bring a nationally known brand to the mix and Sea Salt, which is expanding from its original location in Naples, Florida, should bring additional attention and spark to Sundial's dining options.

But the retail mix to date just does not do much for me because I can either find the same shops elsewhere - Tommy Bahama, Chico's and Lululemon athletic clothing - or the new-to-the-market or locally owned shops are limited in what they offer.

This is a lovely complex in the center of a lively downtown that should become a destination for food but also for other reasons that encourage spending time and spending money. Here's hoping the retail can be amped up enough to shine just as brightly as its neighboring foodie-focused businesses.","2014-12-17 22:01:25"

Been a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.

One thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.

All in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.

"qXooJ5hDf6u__HGKmFRZ6Q",4,"I went to this store to experience the famous Blue Bell ice cream. My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, ""Best on the earth,"" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. 

The Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. 

The young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. 

Now, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. 

Personally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.","2015-03-18 18:18:23"

I had the tortilla soup, which had everything under the sun: tortilla strips, avocado chunks, sour cream, cheese globs, other good stuff that I don't even know about.  My brother got the cheese soup, which was really good also.

I also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.  But the cous de gras, was the chiles, stuffed with shrimp, wrapped in bacon, and sitting in a soy sauce-esque liquid.  UNBELIEVABLE!

 Everything on the menu at Hip City Veg is vegan, though even if you are not vegan/vegetarian I would recommend it because the food tastes really good!

I liked the Udon noodle salad with faux-chicken. I've also had the ziggy burger which I thought was pretty good for a veggie burger (loved the fresh tomato, lettuce and onion) but especially enjoyed the sweet potato fries I had as a side.

There are also some interesting drinks. There is a ""groothie"" which is a greens and fruit smoothie. Personally I thought it was just OK and not that thirst quenching, but it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it so I tried it.

I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.

The menu is straightforward, with a nice variety of appetizers (pinchos), tacos and burgers.   No fuss, no muss.  Being on the veggie side of the street, I ordered and enjoyed the Taco de Papas - which is two tacos with roasted potatoes, poblanos, corn and queso fresco and crema.   Just right.

My wife tried the Doner plate, it came with a nice salad,4 different sauces, fresh fries (which for me were the highlight of the meal), some lamb meat and 2 breads. I tried the Doner Berlin which had almost the same contents (except the fries) stuffed inside a Pita-like bread. Pretty simple. Nothing to really brag about.

We went on a sunday evening around 6:30 pm and we were the only ones there.

Plenty of street parking available within a blocks range.

Staff were friendly but that doesn't compensate for the taste.

Didn't really live up to my expectations I must say. (Maybe I had high expectations to begin with).","2014-08-11 00:54:52"

There is limited seating inside and the menu is not nearly as extensive as its namesake but there are plenty of of satisfying ways to appease your appetite, sate your thirst for iced coffee, get a boost from a juice or make a baked good grab and go.

"88VtuHaKCkliIVzxe02EGA",5,"Booked a 2 Queen & 1 sofa bed suite on the 5th floor for a short stay w/ my family.

The sitting area was a nice, comfortable size with a table, 2 chairs, sofa, coffee table & TV plus a kitchenette with a microwave, small fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker & a small assortment of dishes.

Room was very comfortable & clean, hotel was clean and was also very conveniently located. City center, Reading Terminal etc was only a 5-10 min walk and the Liberty Bell area was only a 15-20 min walk (with children in tow).

"MtGIC7RW9gXzk8o0sFoeig",4,"We went in early June with a group of 11 for an early dinner. The service was excellent. The server was able to guide us as to the best dishes that would fit our taste.

We had the grilled shrimp - very tasty with garlic and olive oil. 

The black paella was delicious - no fishy taste even though it used squid ink. The portion size she said we would get was not as large as she made it sound so if you are a crowd get two.

The battered and fried garlic was amazing - meltingly tender pieces of mellow garlic.

The pork belly was amazing - slightly crisp exterior and yet soft and supple with a rich flavor.

The beef tenderloin with port sauce (?) was very flavorful and best ordered in multiples it is so delicious.

The fried cauliflower was not greasy and had well developed brown notes. 

The Pudin con caramelo for dessert was terrific with a rich caramel sauce. Hot and crusty on the outer edges but a tad cool in the center. Have them cut it in half before they warm it so it is warm throughout.

The regular sangria was fruity and a good value ordered in a pitcher.","2012-07-16 18:49:02"

Eating at this restaurant on a hot, humid summer day brought me back to my trip to Athens, except that I didn't have the view of greek ruins lit up at night, those narrow winding streets, or bottles of mythos on my table (it's a BYOB).

But the food did bring me back to my memories in Greece. We had the dips, moussaka, rabbit, and lamb. I can't say anything bad about them. However, the meal wasn't spectacular...it just didn't have that extra flare for me to give that last star (then again, I'm a big food snob).

"ZLVPEj5TNyYDxRXH8JndKQ",4,"For a small local place, the crab cakes are very delicious. The restaurant is set up like a pizza shop. You order at the counter to eat in or take out. They bring the food to you if you eat in. If you order to go, they call the number on your receipt when your order is ready. 

My fiance and I tried the place out the first week it opened. We each ordered a crab cake platter since they are known for their crab cakes. We also ordered a cup of soup each since it was cold out. The portions were small but the crab cake was very good. It was full of crab and not fillers. 

The soups were amazing! I had a crab chowder and it was full of crab, not too creamy and great seasoning. 

The second time we came, I ordered the crab cake sandwich. The brioche bun was a little too much for the 6 oz crab cake. I had to gut out the bun. That allowed me to enjoy the crab cake more. 

The next day my sister came to visit and wanted to try it. This time we ordered the crab balls. Definitely not as good as the crab cakes. It was full of fillers and not a great way to introduce my sister to it.

We got a salad for lunch one day, a sandwich the next, and a wrap the next. On the last day, we had a banquet. With beer at $7-8, we decided not to buy anything. I was not given a choice of how I wanted my steak and it came out medium and dry. I much prefer a juicy medium rare steak, thanks. Also my friends happened to have great areas of fat on their steak, which was unfortunate. We had a window room that overlooked the pool, but the window was locked shut and the balcony was unreachable. The 3 elevators are very slow and we couldn't even find the stairs the first day because they were hidden away. The trash cans in the rooms are small enough to fit one or two bottles of water.

I worry that this is a case of excessively high expectations (due to the high Yelp ratings), but I've been twice and was underwhelmed both times. The spring rolls mentioned in other reviews were truly beautiful looking, but without the peanut sauce they were flavorless. I also tried the Tom Kha Kai, the papaya salad, a salmon dish that was the special of the evening, a curry, and another dish or two that I can no longer remember. The papaya salad was delicious (although a little light on the papaya part), the rest was forgettable.

Fast forward to today, i decided to stop by since some years had passed.  I ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings...  I just have to say that i was VERY disappointed. The oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat... more fat than meat and small portions at that...the rice was stale.  But what was really disappointing was the jerk wings.. I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn't believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.

Anyway, in the ~2 years that I've worked at my current job, I hadn't tried Hobnobber. I'm not really a seafood fan and their menu consists of a lot of seafood entrees. If you like seafood, this might be the place for you. I finally gave in and accompanied some co-workers last week. 

They recommended the Italian entrees, if I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I opted for the eggplant parmesan. While I didn't have high expectations, it was really quite good. I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).

If you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.

We were barely out of our car before Lily was coming out the door to greet us. Her sweet demeanor and genuine personality were a breath of fresh air. 

She grabbed a golf cart and took us to the row of Ford Edge models. The perfect car for us was indeed on their lot. She took care to show us each model and explain the differences in available options. We knew which one we wanted, so we went inside to start the paperwork. We also met with Michael, the Sales Manager, to negotiate the price we hoped to pay. He easily met us at our price right away and with a smile. We met with Richard on the financing, and he was an absolute joy to work with. 

We drove our beautiful new 2013 Ford Edge off the lot, still beaming from the entire experience.

"KgWadilNjr22RavN1ga5Ng",4,"Little did I know there's an alternate route heading deeper into Santa Barbara County with the 154, and perhaps the one of the things that make the little detour worth the drive is making a stop into this quaint little spot. 

The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. 

We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their ""fancy"" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! 

The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.

I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones.

First I appreciated that because we were on a guest list I didn't have to pay a cover, get frisked or have my handbag rummaged through. I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.

Once downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement. 

Also I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there. Unlike upstairs where the parameters are all open windows, the basement was cave like.

Classic, stylish, clean and very welcoming. Felt comfortable upon entering. Service was top notch, my service was by a very knowledgeable woman named, Heidi. I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle, so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar! I am sad I live far because I would frequent Agustin on a regular and I'd be so happy to return for her service!

THANK YOU Heidi and Agustin Brasserie! I will be back next time I am in Tucson!","2012-07-16 00:47:41"

"qqceKeIlqhuQun3Mxh_3_g",1,"We have loved Schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food. So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? 
I do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests. Live and learn.","2016-10-26 17:09:44"

We had the buffalo wings, artichoke dip with pita, and the free with Yelp checkin homemade chips. Everything was hot and tasty.

There are TV's everywhere and a huge bar with plenty of adult beverage options. We came here for breakfast on a busy Sunday. We were a party of six and were immediately seated. We ordered, scallops, burgers, chicken wings, fish tacos, turkey sandwich, and salads. The wings were perfectly fried with tons of flavor, the scallops were tender & fresh, the sandwich full of lots of fresh shaved turkey, the fish tacos flavorful & fresh, and the salad was fresh, crisp with very good  ranch dressing. The service was speedy and friendly. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars was because the seats in the corner booth lacked cushion. It felt like I was sitting on plywood. Please, fix this soon.

"AGc3jqyPvLKXDaS6yVKm_g",3,"I guess I'm listed as a ""picky"" reviewer on Yelp, but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems.
Walked in at 7:30, gave the name and waited. Soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables. After 15 minutes the lady I gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again. I asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure. Ok, but why couldn't we be seated before that??? I do want to add that in between taking names, she was answering the phone, pouring coffee, ringing up checks and bussing tables. This place sorely needs a host or hostess. The couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated, AND there was another 2 top open behind us. I don't get it. Anyway, the waiter came by, opened the wine and told us about the specials. I guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials. Anyway, another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials. We asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem. I will get to the food, but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co-ordinate the staff. A waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done, yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce. Been nice to get the bread first. The dinner was brought out by a different waitress. At the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart , which we passed on. The original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert, I said no thanks, but we would like the check. In between we kept trying to get someone's attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home. The waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off, one of the waitress' also passed by, but we couldn't get her to stop. Finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it.
Ok, that's the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded , but a lot of other Yelpers note the same problem with service issues. People shouldn't have to sit and wait 15-30 minutes for a table. If this wasn't BYO, then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink. The other thing is, no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting,as many BYO's will do if they can't seat you on time. Nor, did anyone say sorry about the wait.
The food was very good, even as picky as I am. The shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw. The duo, which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great. The crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat. The sirloin slider was excellent, could of eaten a lot of those. The entree's were also top notch. The special Grouper with beans and crab was moist, cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom.
As most of the reviews talk about here, the Lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area. The pasta was light, the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great.
Like I said, take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star. They do have their own lot, but you probably will have to park across the street if it's a weened night. I was glad I put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it's a little hard to find.
Will give them another try in hopes the service improves.","2013-01-27 17:52:36"

Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.

It's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean, neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go!","2013-07-12 20:38:40"

"4VwqS8zmN7TRbpeLOto8HQ",4,"This is an excellent restaurant, and an excellent addition to the neighborhood around Rittenhouse. We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.","2017-11-18 23:43:27"
"JrAJJLqaBamHR6fgzgcyBA",4,"Shepards has been notorious for years for their beach club, The Wave, as well as their Tiki Bar on the holidays. Hey, guess what? It's also a hotel too!

Pretty standard as far as hotel beach resorts go -clean rooms, fairly large (2 queen beds and a couch/sitting area). A restaurant downstairs that serves lunch and dinner buffets (but it wasn't that good, didn't even soak up my alcohol!) and of course the shop where you can buy way overpriced flip-flops if you forgot yours.

Now for the Tiki Bar: large, actually two bars plus a stage area. Overlooks the bay and boats can anchor up here and enjoy the small beach front or walk up and have a tiki-drink. I can't say anything special about the drinks- they weren't specially strong and even for the holiday there was no ""special"" drink (like how about a ""memorial mai tai""?) 
Although there were a good many people there you could still walk around, dance if the notion grabbed you and *bonus* they had misters so it didn't feel too hot (not good for my lobster-lookin' body right now though!).

I have no idea about the nightclub as I have never been but I have heard many a stories about this place.

For an appetizer, we started with the seared scallops, which were delicious. For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet. We had to try it and it seriously turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was such a great way to end our evening. Thank you Jen!  I look forward to returning soon.","2015-08-20 03:51:22"

"hIfcdDHSmVhypozBz0rWqQ",4,"The best gelato and very good pizza.
We came between brunch and dinner, so ate at bar. Had a bottle of the ""best pizza wine""'and liked,it. Ordered two pizzas for the three of us. Plenty. And I eat a lot of pizza.

Pizza reminds me very much of Vetri, and similarly priced (expensive). Excellent ingredients. The style has a soft middle crust, almost white and underdone (to me) which apparently is authentic. Otherwise I would ask for a little more well done, but that might be an insult. You tuck and fold the middle to eat.  I mean, it's delicious, but I feel I shovel too much in that way and lose the individual taste of the fabulous toppings. The outside crust was  puffy and tender.

Nice bartender service and he was really runnng around. I think it was a surprisingly busy day downtown. The gelato is always amazing. I'm in a rut. I always get the Thai coconut and something chocolate or coffee. Some day I will have had my fill of coconut and try other flavors. No I won't!","2017-02-19 13:06:09"
"uMhLOrFjSDeNZT1UzkDv7g",5,"I've tried many ice cream shops in New Orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list. It has by far the best ice cream in town. 

As soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time. It reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the South- it definitely has that old world charm. 

There are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn't love lavender?)

The manager took us to our table, again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.

After being seated, our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction, just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.

I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer, it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours, we had enough.

When I want a late night bite of generals chicken or honey garlic shrimp, SF Kitchen is my top choice. The setting and decor isn't quite Asian Crawfish, but that doesn't matter once your first bite is taken. My wife and I love honey walnut shrimp, and we will try anything that resembles that on any menu. At SF Kitchen you will not be disappointed with the honey garlic shrimp! Usually there is the issue of too much batter, or sauce that's too sweet, or too few shrimp, or ect... But alas, this dish is quite perfect. As I rant and rave about the shrimp dish, the sezchuan beef was on point as well. With that in mind, I cant stop thinking about that shrimp dish.

When I moved into this neighborhood and stumbled upon Springtime, I was pretty out of shape and suffering from chronic back pain. Enter Lisa. She is a fantastically knowledgable instructor with a keen eye and deep knowledge of body mechanics. She worked with me to develop proper alignment, core strength and flexibility. Over the past two years, I've gotten strong, my posture is better, my stamina has improved significantly. And, my core, leg and arm strength have made me much more resilient - I've even started running again (haven't done that for years). Over the two years at Springtime, I've expanded my fitness regime to include training on Red Cord with Peter Madden, and on Gyro with Joyce Chen. This is all in addition to the still challenging Pilates work outs with Lisa.  It's great to be able to engage in a dynamic fitness program that constantly challenges and evolves to keep me growing and improving. Plus the space has tons of natural light and a bank of windows with a private garden view - lovely.

Food:
1) Corn Chowder (special) - heard it was pretty good.
2) Ligurian Shrimp Pasta - nice and fresh.  It def had a spicy kick to it, but not so much that someone like me who can't handle spiciness was able to enjoy a few bites.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and were pretty large.

The donuts here are imaginative and original. I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning. 

New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. 

District has ""croquenuts"" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the ""Monte Cristo"" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.

Finally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. 

Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts.

"GClhNbfPMdTHrGJwumPGMQ",2,"I tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like Sprinkles, but unfortunately I must say that I prefer Sprinkles to The Flying Cupcakes.
First, visually, the frosting-to-cupcake ratio is too small.  I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting. 
Second, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting. 
Third, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately. 

I only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.

The wines we chose were really good we had the cabernet sauvignon and our friend had the malbec which she really enjoyed.

For Dinner I chose the Salmone Campagnolo, the mash potatoes were great however the salmon was definately overcooked and very dry and lacked flavor. Everyone else chose the Saltimbocca, which was also nothing special, have had better on the hill.

"jeQijvSYFa5zA0dJuuDWXA",3,"Was in Philly this past weekend. I usually stay in Center City but all the hotels in the area were sold out because of the Equality Forum. I scored a decent rate of $120/night + tax through Expedia.

In any event, I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. I checked in around 2:30pm. I was greeted by the handsome, energetic front desk clerk and directed to room 225.

While room 225 was definitely one of the larger rooms in the hotel, there's a reason for that. It was a double room designed for someone who uses a wheelchair. I was only staying one night so I didn't bother making a big fuss about it, but I did enjoy the larger size. Some of the accessibility ""extras"", like everything being REALLY low for easier access, took some getting used to. The bathroom area was equally huge, with easy access to the sink and closet area, as well as a water closet and roll-in shower tucked behind a huge sliding door. The shower itself had one of those detachable shower heads as well as a gym-shower style dispenser with body wash and shampoo. 

As for the bed, other than being ridiculously low to the floor (again, for easier access for those in wheelchairs), it was pretty comfortable and I slept pretty soundly. The TV had a decent selection of HDTV channels. Complementary water and coffee was in the room, as well as a mini-fridge in the bathroom area in case you wanted to keep drinks or meds cool. 

The parking fee was $9 with in/out privileges. You had to get a new ticket every time you entered and the front desk would stamp it when you wanted to leave the lot. The lot is pretty large and shared with two other Sheraton properties (They also run a shared shuttle in case you're going to or from the airport.).  

I took a quick look at the pool area. It was pretty empty but again, it's early May and that's to be expected, I guess. There's not much choices for food onsite, other than a quick-service area that's a tad overpriced (again, to be expected). You can drive north maybe 5 minutes on Island Avenue for fast food if you needed to. The bar area looked fun, but again, it was pretty empty for a Saturday.

All in all, if I had to stay outside of Center City Philadelphia again, I'd probably stay here. They really should put one of these in Center City, if you ask me. It'd be perfect.","2013-05-07 15:11:58"

"MBDGL1ScIJkDInhBB-vbFQ",4,"Went for brunch and arrived around 11am. It was crowded already but we were seated at the counter immediately. We started with the Bottomless Drip coffee and Apple Fritter donuts. Loved the donuts and the coffee's flavor was solid, but it could have been hotter. Although, on the plus side, I didn't have to wait for it to cool down before I could drink it. Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I'm late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn't cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn't a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience. It was pricey but you pay for what you get.","2017-03-03 21:27:03"

Luckily, there is a sheet to sign in that lets the staff know who is set to go next, but when I went last Sunday, the girl that works the front desk wasn't in yet, the shop was super short-staffed, and it was basically pandemonium.  It reminded me of Mad Max at the Thunderdome as women hoarded nail polish shades, just to be sure they had a choice in the matter when their time came.  Seats were stolen, bitchy looks were exchanged, and it was just not pretty.  

Once I made it to the back, only slightly worse for the wear, I received adequate service. Though it sort of goes without saying, I preferred the guy that did my manicure, who actually massaged my hands and arms, to the distracted girl that did my pedicure.  She was much more concerned with the Kardashians over her right shoulder and her cell phone in her lap to really worry about me.  She barely massaged my feet or legs at all, and, honestly, isn't that 90% of the experience?","2011-06-29 19:20:41"

This review is not about food, which is very good, but customer service. I came in a few minutes after closing, with people being served plates, just starting to dig in, not looking like they would leave any time soon.

"00n7AuDDL8Ft3gyNdUTtvQ",5,"After spending the better part of a week indulging in gluttony, New Orleans-style, we were looking for something light, fresh, casual, and inexpensive. Our local friend pointed us to Lilly's. She said the woman who used to do here nails at the salon had opened a great Vietnamese restaurant.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by an energetic, friendly woman (Lilly herself?). It was like dining at the home of your favorite aunt; she was pleasantly chatty, enthusiastic, and attentive.

We started out with the spring rolls, which were light and refreshing (these are the ones with soft rice paper, not fried). For our main course I had the grilled beef vermicelli and my girlfriend got the shrimp salad. I'm usually skeptical of ordering salads at Asian restaurants because they often seem to be throw-aways designed to make the menu more friendly to a western eye, but this one was delicious. The shrimp were grilled perfectly and it had a great sweet-spicy-smoky dressing (wish I knew what was in it).

Attention to detail set Lilly's apart. Lightly fried slivers of garlic, perfectly grilled shrimp, fresh chunks of strawberry in the salad -- all the ingredients were carefully selected and prepared lovingly. For a fresh, casual lunch you couldn't do much better.","2012-04-29 14:19:00"

Not too impressed with the food though. The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it's a dish that's kind of hard to screw up. The wrap I got tasted okay, but it tasted like it was made in a microwave (not sure, maybe it was). In general the food reminded me of a mediterranean version of Panera. I don't like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn't great.

My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.

I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.

I generally prefer IHOPs to Waffle Houses. Both are cool in that they are open 24 hours, but IHOP seems to have a larger menu and more variety. ...Especially on their breakfast items. They get seasonal options that I like as well.

This particular IHOP is fairly near to where we live, so it's convenient. It's also right off the Interstate and it seems like its always got a steady crowd there. There are 2 motels next to it and Rummel High School is around the corner. From the various times I have been here, it seems to be a mix of high school students and out of town visitors.

There is a super old rustic feel to the decor, and the bear hide hanging across the wall really completes this place as an old rustic tavern for weary travellers...but in this case, it was more for locals and tourists. 

The food was interesting as we ordered the rabbit, the elk, and venison meats! To my surprise, nothing was gamey and the meat was actually tender and juicy.

For the last 6 years i've had the opportunity to watch and taste the flavors evolve at this place!  They had a rocky start getting their feet under them but they have done a great job!

The waitress then says ""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries, there should have been some discount if it was a sub.

Salt and pepper chicken wings- Very good, not quite as fried/crispy as other places' salt baked wings, but still good.

Scallion pancake- Very good. Fluffier than most places I usually have it. They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.

Taiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.

Beef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.

Service is fine and friendly. Their English isn't great, but it's fine. I did have to explain several times that I wanted the rest of my food wrapped up to go.

"PXQ3APOtktzqM7j-jbCCCw",5,"I first met Olia when doing a series of stories on Nashville's fabulous and talented Fashion Designers.  I immediately fell in love with her personality, energy, designs and true LOVE for what she does. I'll never forget Olia telling me the story that she has literally dreamed of dresses and had to get up and start designing it!  She truly loves what she does and it shows. 

I remember then thinking how much I'd love to use her if I ever were to get married.  Fast forward to today!! Here I am almost 2 years later .. planning my wedding and Olia was the very first person to come to mind.  

Her new shop in Edgehill village is as precious as she and her assistant Brittany are! It's intimate, charming and the perfect place to go try on your dream dress. They were all soooooo attentive. I felt like I was the only bride in the world! 

There are several custom designs to choose from, but the best part is that Olia is the designer and she is there with you the entire way! SO you can change everything about a dress you see that you like, add to it, take away from it - or totally start from scratch and design your very own dress with her!! 

When I decided on ""the one"" .. everyone in the room was as happy as I was! We drank champagne and were all giddy! Even when I needed a little ""confirmation"" that it was ""the one"" -  from a bridesmaid that couldn't come look with me the week before .. she stayed late by appointment one night - to make sure I was happy! Oh and did I mention they will make appointments on Sundays too! So flexible!! 

Then came the ""price"".  Here is the best part ...  I had picked the most expensive lace, satin, stones ... everything! But even then .. it wasn't that bad!! And even better .. you have options! Need to chop off several hundred here ... okay ... just change the type of satin!  Need to save another few hundred there .. different lace.  Etc. 

Olia can work with every brides budget and give you the dress of your dreams!! I honestly can't imagine why anyone would go anywhere else! 

PS
She doesn't just cater to the Bride. She does custom Bridesmaids dresses and mens shirts, ties and suits!","2011-10-28 05:15:15"
"9mX7lZ_DC2jJS4gI8NJLxQ",4,"What's not to like about Mr. Wizard's?  It's definitely a different feel than the other ice cream places around, the crowd's a little more bizarre, and the location (Dogtown-ish) is significantly more convenient for me and my friends.

I came here for the first time the other night and definitely expected not to be wowed, but dammit if it wasn't GOOD!  I ordered a specialty flavor-- ""The Wizard""-- which was chock full of brownies, nuts, I think, and strawberries.  The medium size was bigger than I expected, and it ran me about $5.00, so next time, I'll go for a smaller size.

I like Mr. Wizard's, and I'll definitely be back.  I like the casual neighborhood feel, the thicker, different taste of the custard, and the fact that the location is right.

My partner and I went here twice during our trip. The first time was great. Bar was busy, but we snagged a spot to stand and got great service. Between the delicious cocktails (peanut infusion is a real treat), the upbeat music, and friendly patrons and staff, we thought we had found our spot for the rest of our trip.

The second time was much different. Although the bar was pretty empty, the two bartenders ignored us after our first drink order, chatting up and serving other patrons, but letting our drinks sit empty for over 15 minutes, despite our efforts to catch their eye. It appeared they'd determined middle-aged patrons were a better source of tips and saved their charm for them. When one server finally checked in with us (asking abruptly if we were okay, not suggesting another cocktail or anything to make us feel welcome), our mood had been soured and so we passed on the second drink we'd been planning and moved on to Batch up the street, where the cocktails are just as good and the bartender was happy to serve them.

Sad to offer a less than hearty recommendation because our first trip here was so great. Another review here suggested different experiences based on bartenders, so I guess we're not alone in finding up hut and miss.

The shower in our room dripped all night long; the toilet would not flush properly; consequently it repeatedly overflowed; the tile in the bathroom was broken in several places and dirt had accumulated in the large chipped areas; the facing on the bathroom sink had a huge crack and the toilet paper holder was falling out of the facing; attempts to fix the facing was evident by spackle smeared near the crack and gloves of glue around the toilet paper holder.

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  

I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  

If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be ""politely declined"" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. 

They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.

The atmosphere is minimal and inviting. The bar is covered with a nice copper coating and has ample room for seating. The space itself is very open and offers plenty of sitting for more high volume times. The tap room features board games and darts - not a typical sight at a brewery. The bartenders were friendly and efficient. 

I had the Bailey's Chocolate Oatmeal Stout - delicious! Has a great subtle bitterness, which I assume comes from the chocolate. The oatmeal rounds out the mouthfeel of this beer making it super palatable.

My man-friend had the 17 - an Imperial Stout with Chocolate & Mint. This beer is a home run! I rated it a 5 on UnTappd. Job well done!! Can't wait to cellar one of the 750 ml we took home for a bit and explore this brew again.

"sGP5b2j3lVLmvtW9HFaMxw",1,"It pains me to rate anyone a single star, but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.  

We, a three-some, went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door, smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork, but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good, or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).  

From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared, ripped, with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.  

We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list, the server said, ""We don't have a drink list, but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed, use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.  

The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.  

One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy, the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends, if your mother ever made you mac and cheese, this will be a disappointment.  

My glass of wine was empty for, I don't know, a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.  

The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser, mirror, and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.  

I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur, and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service.","2010-05-16 16:13:52"

"uAPQV0DhZ7Yd7n5CuvNsnQ",2,"I would normally give Honeys 5 stars.

On saturday I went with a group of 7 people. Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it.

But this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating:

The hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.

After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? 

I understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.

"rCXhkfCBhEVLRy3FXz1pOw",3,"Been coming to Casa for 10 years. Only ate in the restaurant side twice! I am a bar guy! The best margaritas in town for the money and I have had them all over town. Bean dip is great and salsa is usually very good, although inconsistent.  Food is usually good, although also hit and miss depending on the kitchen staff on a given night. Sit at the bar and talk with long-time bartender Dave. He will keep laughing and well libated. In short,  if you are looking for decent (sometimes very good) food, great margaritas,  and a very good bartender,  this might be your spot. Zero in on one or two menu items and enjoy the drinks and company.","2015-07-03 21:32:19"

This review is waaaaay overdue.  We arrived to Terrell House for a wedding.  The place is spectacular.  Like stepping into the 1800s, except with all the modern accomodations (AC, etc).

Linda, the owner is a sweetheart.  She's a wonderful and kind person with a whole lot of patience for a 16 month old that thinks every sphere shaped object is a bouncy ball.

Every morning the chef waited for us to come downstairs before putting out some delicious, authentic Louisiana food.  Seriously...it was exceptional.

More of awesome treatment...skipping to the end.  We thanked everyone and left, forgetting our car seat and some other items.  

Linda, shipped the items to us out of her own pocket...!!!!!!  WHAT?  I have never heard of such AMAZING treatment.

There's no other place that I will even consider staying at when I visit New Orleans.

A HUGE thank you Linda and the staff,

"fdwQYTs9OqFnqn5sZVugjA",2,"I've now ventured to Barbara's twice. Once when we were the only people there, and once when we had an hour wait. Both experiences hovered on the border between mediocre and poor.

 I want to like- no-  I want to LOVE Barbara's. It's got some great factors to it:.

- It's literally a hole-in-the-wall. And I tend to gravitate toward these places. 
- The ladies that run the place are full of spunk and love what they do. 
- The homemade bread is delicious. 

But, unfortunately, there are just too many negative factors that will prevent me from wanting to come back.
 
- $10.95 for any meat and two... On par or steeper than most meat and threes in town. 
- The drinks are from a can, with no free refills. 
- Both times I've been there, every single side I've ordered has been cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. 
- The food is simply not great. Greasy fried chicken (I realize those two things are synonymous, but you can have great fried chicken that isn't dripping.), and simply generic southern sides. Nothing special about any of it. I would honestly prefer Loveless, Monell's, even Cracker Barrel .... Any of the southern food staples.  

All that said, this is a loved place by many, and the atmosphere and the people are indeed reason to go. Just don't go expecting great southern food.","2012-10-08 14:16:31"

The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.

"1iIKj7NWc2zOvAWNDsZgQw",1,"I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice, professional, or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually. 

My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer, he was a nice enough guy, we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did, as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business, and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen. 

Fast forward to January, when I called to have my shoes picked up, as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels, one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront, being that it was early in the morning, we had numerous mutual contacts, and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package, the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me, and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days.
10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes, they are not ready. Day 14, I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails, Facebook messages, texts. I get no response. 

Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved, and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner. 

In March 3 months later I run into Alexander, we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names, denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event, he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls, yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up, he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response. 

He shows up the next morning, doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad, I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats, give a description and am told he would look for them, No apology, no explanation given, nothing. 

I get an email asking for the shoes to be described, which I find odd considering that I just did this, and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund, my other shoes found/returned or replaced, only to be answered with ""I never had your flats, and a link to his website. No apology, no receipt. 

Funny, he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes, like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things, and cursed me out. 

The lies, deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund, shoes replacement, receipt, and apology. I got zero response. 

This whole exchange was really frustrating, and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats, it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion, to deceive and steal.

While I am elated that I have my heels back, the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone, and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed, ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.","2014-06-11 17:14:54"

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation.

When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times ""these menus are good for the next 30 seconds.""  Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change, don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were, her words, 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all, so we didn't know what they were for.  Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar, not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one, get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that ""buy one get one"" and ""2 for 1"" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us).  After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that ""they weren't trying to screw us.""  She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars/restaurants/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right.  Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders, she is turning people away for good.

I bought my 1st firearm here and the process was simple and easy. They have a decent connection to the State Police Barracks where it took me all of 3 minutes to get approval. They have a wide selection of guns. Smith and Wesson(s) are normally new and Heckler & Koch. I have never bought a used gun so I can not speak on their selection. 

I have shot a few rounds inside of the range with a few used rifles. They were clean and I asked them to break them down in front of me before my session. They honored that.

Got the cavatelli, the black & blue salad & the meatballs. The cavatelli and black & blue salad are outstanding.  That salad is out of this world and unique while still remaining a classic. The garlic oil they serve w the knots before dinner is also very unique and ridiculously awesome. I loved the Cavatelli so much that it's a shame bc I don't see myself ever wanting to order anything else. My friend had the lasagna which is huge and cheesy and awesome! I would probably definitely order that also. The portions are HUGE & the prices are low for what you're getting!! BYOB 

Also the restaurant is great about substitutions. My friend asked for bolognase sauce on the lasagna which was a great addition. Do it. 

The hostess is great also - ask her for recommendations she's very passionate about the food there and is really funny/nice. 

. The meatballs are good but a little dry/too beefy. The sauce is good too but on the sweet side so it's something u have to be in the mood for. Probably wouldn't order again.  

The tiramisu is good (good enough to order again/if you're in the mood!) but not the besttttt I've had.","2017-12-02 21:01:33"

"_lOGSaUDr79_F-mOOZz5XA",4,"Oh RESCUE it did (and has!)  This is my go-to place when I want to indulge in a truly fabulous facial.  For the reasonable-ish price of $90, the hour-long Classic Rescue Facial leaves you fresh and revitalized -
and your skin feels like a baby's bottom (that is clean, of course).

I've gone to Rescue for a couple years now, and I've had a few deep tissue/swedish massages (no complaints!) but mostly facials.  

The 2nd floor space  (the building is at 17th and Latimer, go in the lobby, take the elevator one floor up) is open, clean, bright, spacious and modern with dark wooden floors.  It feels, smells and looks like a spa. My five senses give Rescue thumbs-up!

The treatment rooms themselves are really nice and roomy and lit just right. Some rooms have pretty chandeliers or have small candles.  Sheets, robes and all the accoutrements are clean and soft.

Staff are polite, casual and down to earth.  If they're not busy or booked back to back, they'll offer you some delicious what-have-you infused water or beverage of your choosing.

I hear their makeup artist on staff is really good - and I've seen her do her thing on occasion (she works on her clientele right there in the open -so you get to watch)

Few drawbacks, never had a mani/pedi here, so I can't attest to the quality or whether they're worth it, but word to the wise, like other reviews have mentioned, there are no pedi chairs - just basically a wooden bench with some loose pillows - which doesn't strike me as relaxing or remotely comfortable. 

Also, the changing rooms are basically non-existent. One for women and one for men - which leaves you with no privacy if you want to change and shower at your leisure.  There's nothing calming about waiting for the change room to free up or rushing to change or shower so someone else can get in. (what is this, a YMCA?)  On busy weekends, the waiting areas tend to fill up too - so it can get a little 'packed'.

Lastly, some of the esthesticians have a tendency to really push their products - which I hate and find annoying especially when I'm already spending good money getting a treatment - - so buyer beware, as the line of products they carry are pretty expensive.

But cons, aside, I'll still go back to Rescue and look forward to trying out other treatments.","2009-03-03 20:56:18"

Buzzzzzzz. Wrong. When we entered, we were shuffled over to a seat that was a mile away from the aquarium and told, ""Oh. There are many people with reservations expected."" Afterwards, an older couple asked the same question about being seated closer to the tank, and their wrinkly old butts were escorted front and center. Ageism at its finest! In the end, my wife and I and the old couple walked away with relatively the same experience though because the food was awful. Don't order fish. You will be treated to a large hunk of dry protein that has no taste and is topped with cranberries. Remember Thanksgiving at Grandma's house? Large overlooked dry as f turkey that you had to choke down with 8 glasses of Sprite? Bingo. Rumfish Grill. I called my grandma immediately afterward and told her that she needed to sue the place for stealing her turkey recipe. She was puzzled since we ordered fish.

"JN0WTWXIuTzwBVP01PDz3w",4,"Despite the fact that this place is in an iffy area on 9th St N (MLK St N), I was willing to try it out because my friend had just been there and she recommended it. She also recommended a masseuse named Theresa, so I made an appt with her. It's located at the corner of 9th St N and 28th Ave N. Park on 28th Ave N, then walk around the corner to it.

The masseuse was pretty good, except for she kept on massaging the areas where I was super ticklish. I felt like it was defeating the purpose of my massage because I totally tensed up each time she went to those spots. Also, she insisted that my glutes are tight and spent a lot of time there (one of my ticklish spots), even though I haven't ran or did anything on my feet in forever. *shrug* Her rates are cheap though so I can't complain much.

I told her that a friend recommended her, so my first appt was only $25. You can go on an individual basis or get a package of 4 massages for $120 (I think), which is pretty cheap and I considered getting it, but decided to wait. You can request a Swedish massage or a deep tissue massage.

Oh, this place also does hair cutting and manicures and pedicures, so at first you will smell the acetone. But, no worries, you won't smell anything once inside the massage room.

I appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle.

I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.

"8kv-UdzBtydkFC_GY8CEEQ",5,"As avid brewery connoisseurs and current Nashville locals, we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at Tennessee Brew Works this evening.

 It was a dreary, rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the ""Tennessee Fill Station"" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the ""Tennessee Tap Room"" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the ""Tennessee Brew Works"" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading. 

The tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or ""catwalk"" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. 

Biggest fortes:

- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.
- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.
- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.

"IzylDtyp3mDfISIl3j86DA",2,"Over priced and over hyped.  We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.  Check out their menu online and check out their prices.  They don't do breakfast, but if you're ever in NYC and get a chance to go there, do it.

I feel the admission prices were fair ($24.95pp with AAA card). We spent 5 hours there so it was about $5/hr per person! We purchased a small locker that was large enough for my large purse, diaper bag, towels and our shoes. The place smelled strongly of chlorine, but it's an indoor water park...that's what it should smell like. The lines were moderately long, but it was a weekend and we knew what we were getting into when we planned the trip. The water temperatures and indoor temperatures were comfortable. The only thing I did not like was the mat that is in the food court area...it sort of hurts your feet if you are barefoot. We did not like waiting in a line to order food and then waiting in another line outside to pick it up, but we tolerated it. i don;t know why people are saying there are no tables and no shade....we sat at a table with shade and we ended up having to move because it was too shady. We purchased the bucket of chicken fingers and french fries for $30. There were way to many french fries and we had to walk the bucket to the car to keep it stored. If we put it in the locker, everything would've smelled like grease. The bucket should also be priced at $25 being that it is mostly french fries...or it should include fresh fruit/cookies. There is a wave pool as well and I don't know why someone said there isn't. We spent a lot of time in the wave pool as my kids loved it. There were lifeguards everywhere so safety wasn't an issue.

"YVSKj8xUPO55F1kbhzTqQQ",4,"I am always skeptical of Restaurant Week... You never know what service or the food will be like but you go in with that in mind... WELL fellow Yelpers.. I must say that I was surprisingly blown away by both! 

We had a reservation for 6 but at the last minute we had another guest join us. When I called the restaurant to make sure it was ok, the gentlemen was more than happy to add one to our reservation.  Upon arrival we headed to the bar to wait for the rest of our group to arrive.  Bar menu was great, they have a lot of bottled beers to choose from...no drafts.. weird..

The food was really good!  For restaurant week I never have my hopes set too high...ist that bad??  I started with the Ceasar Salad, then the Ribeye and for dessert I ordered the Chocolate cake.. Salad was yummy, steak was done to perfection!!  I was not at all pleased with the chocolate cake (i love cake) BUT my friends bread pudding was pretty tasty!  

We will definitely return.  Our server Melissa was really sweet too!","2014-02-05 20:52:08"

"hSMKrUFIYxbDoM2FWLOz5g",5,"We went on a Friday afternoon.  There was hardly anyone in the place, which was a bit worrisome initially.  However once we got our food and drinks soon realized this place was great!

The waitstaff was excellent.  We had 2 different servers, as we stayed for a long time and the first waitress was getting off.  Our service was seamless.  The food was good, but the presentation of each dish was not what food critics would consider visually stunning.  The nachos were freaking huge!  As a nacho connoisseur I found this to be delightful.  The drinks were very good and they have a nice house drink menu.

The view of John's pass is really nice.  They have an outdoor area with a few seats that would be good in less windy weather than we experienced.  This would also be a good place to park your boat and come in for a bite to eat.","2014-11-12 15:54:31"

"Is_33ES6ooMekWVUOon1jQ",1,"If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda, tea, lemonade, etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store. 

We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server, she responded ""Oh I thought she told you we ran out"". Mind you, that is completely fine, but what if someone had a seafood allergy? 

To top it off, 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded, ""I honestly don't even know what you ordered"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't, we asked again. At this time, our ""server"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE. 

I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates, but everything else was on paper plates.

I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.  

Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned.","2014-11-30 14:52:08"

 I contacted Jimmy at O'Neill and he came out on a Sunday to look at our house and go over some options.  He emailed me an estimate the next day with several options.  He recommend only repairing the right side of the house from the top of the windows down.  Jimmy advised that the rest of the stone was in good shape.  In his estimate he included repair the gaps around our windows and the door at the rear of our house.  The option he recommend was the least expensive on his estimate.  I appreciated Jimmy's honesty.  He wasn't just out to make money.

I accepted the estimate and the work started on a Friday.  His masons were very professional and kept a very clean work area.  My neighbors actually commented on how neat and friendly they were.

"sVMZ9sgBqM7yEgOh2-OUZA",2,"Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. 

When I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.

Now, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.

The staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.

The ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.

The food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. 

The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.

Obviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.","2016-01-04 05:53:55"

However, the restaurant staff heard our English accents and decided that they could take us for a ride with the tip.  When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.

I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.

"71L_YVQmtMksii5Bz2P1SA",3,"Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.

And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. 

Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.","2010-01-08 16:26:03"

I was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because I didn't realize they allowed customization.

The mango, I will probs not get again. Was syrupy and overly sweet (before I knew to ask for reduction in sweetness) and tasted a bit too artificial for me. I will have to  stick to the milk teas. Also wish they added a few more bubbles.

This was typical of the excellent service.

We went around 6pm for happy hour so, understandably the bar was busy but that is no excuse for poor service. Two of my friends and I had a seat at the bar. There were only two seats available at the bar and when we asked the bartender if there were any extra available seats he just told us, ""what we have is what we have"", and kept on doing what he was doing- he didn't offer any suggestions or apologize for not having enough seating. Throughout happy hour when we ordered food the bartender barely made eye contact or acknowledged us he simply would barely nod without saying anything and at some point he slammed my friends beer down. Eventually I said something to the manager and the bartender warmed up but by then we were done with our night there. Honestly, we would have gone somewhere else in the beginning after the first rude response but 6pm on a Friday in the CWE it would've been more of a hassle to go somewhere else and find parking.

"iaDxALqJllpktwN0AxaXig",4,"This Wendy's just recently went through a much-needed renovation and it looks a lot better than it previously did. I walked in here to grab a lunch order recently around 12:30 and it was 80% full of dine-in customers. 

Unfortunately there was a clan of about a dozen senior citizens in front of me that couldn't make up their minds. 

I walked out, got back into my car and went right to the drive thru. The employee taking my order was clear through the speaker and very polite. I got to the window and realized I forgot an item and she added it on my order, updated my price and took care of it very easily. 

The drive thru process saved me a few minutes, as I'm sure the staff inside was just as efficient as the drive thru staff. 

My food was good and hot when I ate it. The fries didn't have a ton of salt, which I really prefer. My burger wasn't very big but was good. 

Inside was a very nice flat screen TV, which I have never seen in any Wendy's before. They also have the Coke freestyle machine, which is a very nice feature. This Wendy's is by far one of the nicer locations in all of Tampa. 

My issue with Wendy's is that they advertise these huge juicy burgers on TV. They look fantastic but when you unwrap them it's very disappointing as they are extremely small. I get that every restaurant does this during advertising, but Wendy's really exaggerates their product on TV. 

Wendy's is like a person on a dating website that displays their best pictures and their best qualities, except it's nothing like the pictures when you see it in person and is a major disappointment.","2016-12-04 04:06:41"

I arrived about 20 minutes before my appointment and was quickly attended to (by the owner) without even having to sit down. I sat in the stylist's chair, and we discussed the cut and style I was hoping for.
She then sent me down to have my hair washed, which was a perfectly pleasant experience. Certainly a more thorough one than I usually undertake. Once complete, I headed back to the stylist.

She confirmed our plan and assured me that she had a great plan. During the cut, she was nice (not too talkative), funny, inquisitive, and calm. She answered all the questions I had about how best to care for the cut and offered suggestions on how to ensure that I got the most out of  it. I could not be happier with how the cut and style turned out - no matter how the rest of me looks, I know my hair is kickin'.

In the end, the price was well more than advertised, but not so much that I would balk at it for the value.

Wachttijden kunnen oplopen, maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt, gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is, zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor, maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet geïrriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond, maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed.

"CmdRIsHtLEWTBC3Wk0tRpQ",2,"I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.

I decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.

I will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly.","2012-04-28 16:36:38"

Cold Noodles in Chili Oil: I learned that the taste of the cold noodles depends on the master chef. IMHO, the master chef at the U City location makes a better cold noodle in chili oil dish

Ambiance: Home-y but very small and cramped. Luckily it wasn't too busy on a Monday night. Can't imagine the place packed given it was already hard to hold a conversation given we could hear the other two tables talking around us (BYOB makes everyone a bit louder).

Service: There was one waiter and one busboy working and they had everything covered. Made solid food recommendations and were attentive. Our waiter was also extremely friendly.

Food: Solid italian food. Nothing out of this world, but good. We got a special appetizer - Italian Empanada...Sounds weird, but it was very flaky, delicious party in a slightly spicy marinara. Very delicious. My main entre was the beef osso bucco. The meat was delicious, but don't expect any bone marrow with this dish. My girlfriend ordered a fettucine special which was ok. Noodles were homemade, but the sauce was a little off.

"Qa3ndQYmzmhMWm3LcYsQUg",5,"Tony's is the real deal. My wife picked up a rock in Tucson a few weeks back and it made about a 20"" crack from the edge of the front windshield to the middle on the driver's side. Being a frugal person, I was hoping to get it repaired...but, after doing some Internet research it became obvious this was not going to be possible or cost effective. I read reviews of places around the area and contacted about 4 of them. Tony's had the fastest response and was the most honest in answering my questions. I dealt with Hector and I was impressed. No BS...he answered all my questions in a straight-forward honest manner. I was under the mistaken impression that there was an Antenna in the front windshield which Hector correctly told me there wasn't. After educating myself on issues with Windshields, I asked Hector who was the manufacturer of the glass they used. He told me who they used, why they used them, and why they were top quality. Other companies in town did not respond to this question...seriously, the top rated guy on Yelp, quit answering my emails when I asked him who manufactured the glass he used...REALLY? Now, the kicker is Tony's price was the lowest of all 4 I contacted. And, not just a few dollars...he charged $125 including taxes...I had no idea you could get a front windshield replaced for that. The others were anywhere from $37 to $100+ more. Hector, keep up the good work...I will refer anyone I know to your place for any glass work.","2014-06-11 17:00:48"

"AEUNAS3cg7pVVS1ioee9PQ",1,"If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against, disrespected, and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the ""show."" 
He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude.

This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however, they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas, I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.   We placed our order to go because we love to eat at home, however they have a huge dining area and flat screen t.v. with soccer playing last time we went.

Service:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.

Food:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.

Overall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.","2011-10-27 15:28:04"

Came here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit.

"1-pcjwBn_zFPcMILH887Xg",2,"This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  

Bad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. 

Good - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.

In summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.","2017-02-19 13:57:50"

Since the crust was no great shakes, the sticks weren't any better. Food taste alone- sadly the better frozen pies can surpass these guys. Maybe with some time they can tweak what they are doing- they have great ideas going- just need to get a much better product out the door.

"5__JjkQWxf66XLkWvxdr5g",3,"My husband and I dined here for the first time last night to celebrate his birthday. Here's the breakdown!
Atmosphere-
This restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.
Service-
Our waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. 
Food- 
I loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!

I might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!","2012-04-28 12:23:09"

"ScgUWBtv2XxrFzEMar5tcw",2,"It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. 

Actually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. 

The food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.","2013-06-24 18:08:09"

"My5_NW3psV9AJA9KmQXiAQ",1,"I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.

We reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up, we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this, great!  While we waited for our match to come back online, someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group, but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.

After several minutes our scores disappeared, and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone, you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset, he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still ""get out of my face, I don't care""

I understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service, but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.","2016-01-17 20:01:38"

The food is pretty good (appetizers somehow always being the highlight), but it is always SUPER crowded. Like, constantly apologizing to your neighbors for knocking elbows crowded. The tables are very close so that they can fit everyone. This also makes it difficult to carry a conversation

But the main reason for only 2 stars is the SERVICE! I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said ""oh..."", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.

Something similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time! I get that the buffet is easier for them, but come on! It's not asking for anything crazy, just MENUS! At least make an effort to hide it until you get into the kitchen...","2013-12-29 06:38:12"
"556ozG8Mac7Gg4zeqBybcA",4,"What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.

Like Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  

As serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  

The atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.","2012-07-16 01:34:13"
"Le_F13di3RBf5wqxS25mFA",4,"I've been staying at this hotel for about four weeks (on work assignment in Trenton) and it's definitely one of the most modern hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are nicely appointed and the bed is amazingly comfortable. 

It's a really popular spot for business travelers and it's definitely seen a lot of hard use. That's why I can't give it five stars, because their facilities people don't seem to keep the rooms in fantastic condition nor do the housekeepers do a lot of the 'little things' (like dusting/cleaning the top of the enormous shower heads or making sure all the drawers are flushed and leveled) that set other places apart.

The breakfasts are okay, for what they are... it's not the Ritz Carlton or W.A., so anyone who gripes about the food needs to lower their expectations a little. The coffee is kind of horrible but that's okay b/c there's a Starbucks in the lobby of the Courtyard across the street or one exit up in Ewing. I knew what I was getting (having stayed in other extended-stay type hotels) when I booked my stays and I was not surprised.

All in all, it's the favorite hotel of my team and we'll continue staying here when we're on assignment in Trenton.

Tips:

-East Sushi and Palermo's Pizza are two really good delivery places nearby and the front desk folks will give you menus.
-Metro Grill is a fairly good sit-down place nearby.
-Masa 8 is a very good sushi joint about two exits up.
-Mikonos (Greek) is iffy, probably should avoid it.
-Buy your beer and wine at the liquor store one exit up (it's in the same shopping center with the Starbucks, plus there's a supermarket there too)... $6/bottle for a Sam Adams is a little steep.
-There's also a really good Italian place in that shopping center - Piccolo Trattoria.
-They have a huge gas grill on the patio at this hotel... another team from my company has done a lot of grilling here, so if you're going to be at the element for a while with a team, it's a great way to hang out and have dinner together.
-If the lobby music is making you crazy, ask them to turn it down or off... especially later on in the evening if you happen to be in the lobby.","2013-10-24 03:09:29"
"v3nFwwyqo-Qzy4ASa1OLxg",4,"Some foodie friends have been talking this place up to me so I finally decided to check it out, and it was definitely worth it.

The dumplings of the day were Pork and Mung Bean, and they were decent.  The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.

I also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter.","2013-06-24 17:45:45"

This time you were on point Castillo Inn! I reserved the same room as last time because it was very roomy and pretty. There were four of us. The tp and towels were stocked nicely and we didn't run out of either. The wifi was free and fast. The morning breakfast treats were great. My mom loved having her coffee, pastries and fruit. The beds were very comfy. Loved being so close to everything. We didn't have to drive much since everything is a short walk away, or you can ride the trolleys or the water taxi. Had so much fun!

Our waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn't be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.

The fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It's very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the ""Hay and Straw"" and loved it.

"UKH8JWf3nRZdGqX7i7KyTw",4,"Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan, I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.

I've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so ""gently"" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.

The place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. 

On New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.

I indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari ""noodles"". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more ""decomposed"" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. 

I wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell ""Service!"" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll ""relay their compliments to Kevin"" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.

Will I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.","2013-01-03 18:04:53"

"_PF_93peWE8D-4ZnJU8W9Q",4,"This is one of the few hotels I have visited just to visit, and not to stay at. It's beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side/back entrance of Opryland. You will save $20+ from not parking in the front.","2015-05-12 17:53:03"

Our orders were taken promptly, the correct food arrived, and my burger and fries were hot and fresh.  I tried the mushroom burger with turkey and it was loaded with mushrooms.  The server even brought us fries while we waited because it was taking longer than ten minutes.  She made sure to keep our water glasses full.  If you can, try to sit in Janesca's section, and you will be well taken care of.  
     The other servers I had gotten bad service from still work there as I saw a few of them walking around.  Hopefully they have improved since my bad experiences.  The only other complaint I have is this place really needs to be dusted!

"4FIySV5ppFRunDeb3kHgEw",5,"Speaking as a current resident of the Florida gulf coast, and former resident of the central California coast, it pains me to admit it but the oysters at Luke are the best I've ever had. And I've had them picked same-day from the Monterey Bay. It surprised me to learn that the oysters are harvested from New Orleans, I had no idea that N.O. had access to such top notch shellfish. Anyways happy hour features deals on signature cocktails, 75 cent oysters and cheap apps, I went there twice during my week in N.O. and I should have gone more. 

Other than the amazing briny ice cold oysters, my wife and I also had a selection of various apps and cocktails all of which were in the good to excellent range. The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle. It made me go home and plant a squash just so I can harvest the blossoms and recreate this dish. Luke hits a nice balance between casual and formal, from the atmosphere to the menu to the prices. Not to be missed.","2016-06-22 22:57:52"

Their BBQ sauces are a little mustardy all-around, but they mesh well with different menu items and equalize. I love that there are vegetarian options but I doubt they attract many with it when the next door panini bar sounds like better fare for veggie fans. 

Hickory Kitchen lacks in space. They got slammed with throngs of screaming young families moments after we calmly sat down in a cozy sunny corner with our order placed. This meant our meal was - by us - rushed to make space. I don't know if it was standard for a Saturday, but they earn some big props for calling down the owner who ran in to bus tables and take over the register for his employees. 

Overall: possibly beware screaming young family crowd for lunch, be assured they call for reinforcements rather than let you suffer, and solid yumminess to expect - get the fries - and feel slightly food comatose the remainder of the day.","2013-12-29 16:00:44"

He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  

You can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon. Last but not least, they have great happy hour specials, and the classic Citywide shot and beer combo.

We opted to take the bus from NOLA and was glad that we did. Our driver was so-so and he attempted to give us a tour from town out to the dock but sadly it was lacking (this is why I am deducting half a star...you will see why the other half star deduction...just keep reading). I think there was a language barrier and that kind of sucked. Oh, and he was 30 minutes late. That was a little frustrating. We took the first tour so this meant I could have spent an extra 30 minutes sleeping. Boo!

Once we got there we checked in and it was rather chaotic (the other half star deduction). You walk in and see a long line for tickets. The bad thing was that it is in the center of the gift shop. That made shopping rather difficult. This is probably not a good thing for revenue. The dumb this was that there was a register in the back...which was closed! 

The tour itself was great! Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed him. He gave us a history of the swamp and offered tons of info about the elusive gators of the bayou. We saw a number of them and even got to hold a baby. How awesome is that? Let me tell you, it was pretty darn awesome! I highly recommend that you request a covered boat. The poor people with the open boat were sweating like you couldn't believe. I thought it was very interesting that we did not encounter one mosquito! Amazing!

 My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it.

"1wNeIingO4qxZOdpuE3aJA",3,"3.5 stars

Hubs and I decided to stop in this place after driving past it on several occasions.  I am very glad we did because we find all kinds of deals here.  Granted, we sometimes ""over-shop"" because of low prices, but with the savings we are actually breaking even.

How do I know prices are good?  Well I am one of those people that, for whatever reason, tends to memorize prices from my other grocery retailers whether I want to or not.  For example, a 20 ounce Red Bull here is $2.40 while the exact same thing at another store is in the $4.50+ range.  

Just this past weekend we bought a Keurig K300 for $80.80.  The same item retailed for over $100 at several other places nearby.

So why just 3.5 stars if I am saving money and am now flush with cash*?  Well the downside is that unlike a typical grocery chain you cannot necessarily find all the brands you are looking for when shopping.  That makes it inevitable that I have to make a trip to a separate store if I have specific needs which cannot be met at IGA.  But I do start my shopping here to get what I can before I go to round two.

The employees are helpful, the place is neat and clean and the prices rock.

Hendel's is that special kind of place.

When a coworker convinced me to eat there for lunch, I thought, ""Where the hell are you taking me?!"" as he turned off Lindbergh onto some seemingly random local roads.  I found myself in an area untouched by the familiar quazi-ghetto strip malls that I felt personified Florissant.

Eating outside is a huge recommendation on the patio with the well tended garden and the overall cozy feel of the place.  The service is friendly and the food is very good, but nothing spectacular.

"3MEJ8-95g8lj_D8S0HFpuQ",4,"I'll start this long overdue review by stating that Children's Hospital saved my infant son's life in April this year.  Born at East Jefferson General Hospital, my son was quickly transferred to Children's Hospital New Orleans (CHNOLA) with a life- threatening illness.

We found ourselves in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and I can honestly say that this is one of the best units in the hospital. Our son was immediately assessed and within a few hours, was already being tested to diagnose his condition.  Within 8 hours and after a host of tests, our son was diagnosed and assigned a neonatologist, 3 separate specialists and a nurse. 

His treatment began immediately and we spent nearly a month in the NICU.  Parents are allowed to stay at their child's side with the exception of shift changes from 7:00-8:00 am and 7:00-8:00 pm.  I hope no parent ever has to experience what my wife and I felt, but looking back now, we can honestly say that the NICU is the best unit unit in the hospital; and we have visited many of the clinics there for his follow up visits.

We spent every single day with our son and got to personally know every doctor and nurse assigned to him for the day.  It takes a special doctor or nurse to work in the NICU, and the nurses are like angels.  The NICU nurses, for lack of a better term, are like surrogate parents to the sick children they care for.  It is more than a job to them.  Watching them care for my son and his roommate (most NICU rooms are double occupancy), I quickly learned that the nurses are totally committed to their patients.  Many of the children in the NICU are from cities across the state and some parents can only come to visit on the weekends as they have to work to pay their bills. But the nurses hold them and rock them and talk to them as if they were their parents.  Seeing them in action is a humbling experience, but an experience I hope that none of you ever experience.

We have only had to visit the E.R. twice and it is a top notch facility.  However, there are so many patients waiting to be seen (every day) that the wait can easily exceed 5-6 hours.  What's worse is that many of the patients and their parents are coughing and possibly spreading germs throughout the E.R.  If you do find yourself in the E.R., I would suggest waiting in the hallway with your child while he/she is waiting to be seen.  Hopefully you can avoid leaving with an illness that you didn't arrive with.

Once a patient is discharged from CHNOLA. they are often assigned to follow up visits at one or more of the hospital's many clinics. One of the most overworked clinic is the hemotology/oncology clinic.  If you ever find yourself a patient of this clinic, make sure you bring at least 2 or 3 extra bottles for your child as the wait time from checking in, to triage, to lab and then being seen in the clinic can easily exceed 6 hours.  Everyone there on their staff is very nice.  However, the staff is completely overworked and booked solid from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Do yourself a favor and book the earliest appointment you can.  You'll be glad that you did.

On a more positive note, I have nothing but great things to say about both the occupational therapy clinic and physical therapy clinic.  Both clinics are appointment only and if you are late, you are not allowed at all to infringe upon the next patient's time slot; which is the way it should be.  The therapists are are great and are truly excited and enthusiastic about their jobs; and it shows.

Many of the patients in CHNOLA are there for a long time, and ther parents often spend time in hotels occasionally so that they can spend more time with their child without having to go home.  The CHNOLA cafeteria offers deeply discounted meals to parents of admitted patients, and we spent a solid month eating breakfast, lunch and dinner there.  It's just a small way for the hospital to offer something back to the parent, and the food is actually quite good.

I gues the best thing about CHNOLA is the attitude of the staff.  Overall, everyone is extremely nice and sympathetic to your needs.  Most parents are already in a fragile state and the staff recognizes this and does their best to accomodate you.  

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the extremely long wait times in some of the clinics.  Hopefully through the yearly telethons, donations and possiible government assistance, the hospital can obtain the necessary finding to increase its staffing relative to its patients needs.","2012-12-05 02:03:33"

The stylist are extremely talented. Their work is amazing  the staff go to a lot of Trainings all over the country to keep up with techniques .

I crave for this Pizza anytime I am eating some other knock off meat pizza from dominos or pizza hut. The ingrdedients, the crust, just everything together makes this my go to pizza.

I will say the wait time does take a little longer than I would like But for what I'm getting, it's definitely worth it. 

The restaurant is a cute fever dream of large mushrooms and trippy colors. I definitely like to stay and eat so my pizza is fresh out the kitchen but taking it to go is fine as well, the pizza will hold.

After finding the restaurant in a back alley and knocking on the door to get in, we were seated promptly in the front room.  Reservations would be a good idea on weekend nights especially.  

The food was yummy - not earth shattering perhaps, but definitely a good range and interesting for a fixed course meal.  We chose the spicy chicken and the beef kabobs, and they were probably the best two courses (well besides baklava and mint tea being so awesomely delicious).  We also called ahead and found out that although they now have a full bar, you can still bring in a bottle of wine.  Definitely a good deal - heads up that some of the servers seem rather confused about the policy.

Our entrees were great, though. I had a lamb special, which was incredible, and my wife's pasta was also very good. 

A couple weird things: 1) the space is a little small, to the point where the servers are tripping over each other; 2) the music choice was strange for an Italian place (mid-90s country) - I wasn't looking for Dean Martin or anything, but it was an odd choice.","2018-06-19 16:04:41"

We enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions.   One of the best features of Blondie's is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous, Blondie's is a nice oasis away from all of this. 

Food and drink:
Blondie's offers an above average list of wines by the glass, and some very nice beer selections.  I enjoyed several red wines, a cava, and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits.  They also offer a limited menu of smaller plates, charcuterie and the likes, from which I have not ordered.  Given their offerings, I'm sure these are quite nice.  Also a very nice feature is their $4 wine nights on Wednesdays, which is always a plus.

The museum gives you an insight into how the company came up and how they survived during the prohibition. While you wait for your tour you can grab a bite and beer and roam around the lobby or chill at the Biergarten - an excellent outdoor spot.

"TE3gO-Shs5DzayyXXVc6xg",5,"This tiny Mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and Spruce may not look like too much from the outside, but once you step inside, the experience is sure to blow you away. I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. 

My first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. 

Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. 

I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!","2011-02-14 22:08:53"

If there hadn't been upbeat, Latin music playing throughout the restaurant, I would have mistaken this place for the waiting room at my gynecologist's office....no fun!","2014-09-09 20:11:41"

Food - everything we ordered was great! Thanks for all the yelp recommendations. We went with the shrimp and goat cheese crepe, shrimp and andouille sausage omlet, and eggs benedict. We were so stuffed we couldn't bring ourselves to order the bread pudding. 

Music - at first we couldn't really hear the music, but to our pleasant surprise, the band moved from room too room and ended up playing right next to our table! The musicians were amazing. Loved all their energy and talent.

"GrcKauE5VTDuIRdJ4j3mcw",5,"There's a room here that you've just GOT to see.

I absolutely love the IMA.  Adore it, even.  Remember that campaign they ran a few years ago - ""It's MY Art""?  I totally embrace that.  There's truly something for everyone here from the stellar European gallery to the cutting edge contemporary art.  The 100 Acres and outdoor gardens simply can't be missed.  Oh, and don't forget to take a day and visit the Lilly mansion.  It's breathtaking.  

Did I mention the best part, yet?  It's all FREE!!!  You get to experience art, and you get to experience art, and YOU get to experience art! (In my Oprah Winfrey Voice, lol)

If you haven't visited the IMA recently, make an effort to go ASAP-tually.  They're open late (until 9) on Thursdays!

Oh, and about that room?  Ask for James Turrell.  It's the ONE piece of art that you actually get to touch. ;-)","2014-06-11 15:09:20"
"LKXD9GUeSrlSAChRVA2E4g",3,"3 stars means I like it and I'll be back for more. I love Cuban food.

I lived in Tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of Cuban food. I'm excited to have another Cuban place here in Indy. There aren't many. 

When I think of good Cuban food, I think of Cuban bread, yucca, plantains, pork and cafe con leche...just to name a few.

Today, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.

There were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It's just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn't bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I've ever eaten was much better. Even if it's pressed, I've never had cracker-like Cuban bread.

Cuban bread is something that I would order as a side, I love it so much. This bread missed the mark.

Maybe I missed it, but there was no yucca on the menu. I really love good Cuban yucca. That was the other miss.","2016-03-07 01:41:26"

Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!

"_Y0NWUmO0KxmTw5hi53lmQ",4,"I'm officially an uptown girl... well, at least since I got my apartment on Carrollton. I love being uptown, for the most part, and the Fly is one of those places that you kill some time with friends and on more than a few occasions, alcohol and man's best friend. 

I used to play soccer for high school and this is where all of my practices and games were held. The soccer fields are off limits to the public... very off limits. If my ex-coach is out there, he will chase you off the field. 

The area is usually clean, but since so many people love having picnics there, sometimes you have a group that doesn't like to pick up after themselves. 

It's a pretty good place for dogs. My only concern would be the train track nearby... I'd keep a close eye on my dog if a train is coming. I'm not sure that the leash-policy is, but I've never gotten fussed at or asked to put my dog on a leash. 

There's a nice view of the river... and all it's lovely traffic. It's a cool place to bring out the towels and tanning oil for girls... also a cool place for guys to take off the shirts and toss around a football or a frisbee.

Customers are mostly Penn students, business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons. 

Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it, but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes.

They also sell some locally made goods, such as purses made from the roof of the old RCA dome.  Somewhat surprisingly, they sell furniture as well.  The location is nice, right next to Starbucks on Mass Ave.

The reason I give it 3 stars is that it seems really overpriced.  I'm not a jewelry expert, so I can't comment on those prices.  They may be quite legitimate.  A lot of the jewelry is really beautiful, and made by artists.  But all of the gifty items cost at least twice what I would have expected.  There may be a reason for this that I'm not aware of--I do know that some items are printed on recycled paper and reused materials.  I respect that.  But other items really seem unreasonable, like the $8 bar of soap or the $20 bento box.  As someone who has to live on a budget, this is a bit of a turn off.

I had the Chicken Jack and Bacon sandwich, which had a good size hunk of chicken in it, along with the cheese, bacon, tomato and onion, but strangely absolutely no sauce or dressing of any kind, making it rather dry.  Other than that, it was good, and everyone else seemed content with their meal.  Our server was attentive and patient, and all our meals were served at the same time, eliminating that awkward ""waiting"" stage that often happens with larger parties.

However, there was bad news - the children's meal no longer includes a dessert of Dirt and Worms, which (as silly as it may seem) has always been the main attraction of Tony Roma's if kids are along.   We had to pay an extra dollar for a small scoop of freezer-burned vanilla ice cream which neither child finished, nor any adult wanted to eat because of the crystallization of it.  It's funny how Dirt and Worms has become a tradition for us, and the meal didn't seem complete without it.  Hey, Tony, you may have lost some customers over that pudding and cookie crumbs and gummy worm ""cost-cutting"" elimination.  Others may value you for your ribs, but for us it was the giggles over chocolate-covered faces that made us leave with a smile on our faces.","2014-07-28 08:03:33"

Last night was my first time at the actual restaurant. It was a large group so in total I tried the blue duck fries, general tso's wings, the pork roll burger, house blend burger, quack and cheese and classic Mac. If you have a large group make sure they want to share because you're going to want to try everything. It's all amazing and will make you want to come back the next day.

"sCXH6IWTNha4fpxrTkO9Wg",5,"Han Dynasty is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.

Eventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more ""hip.""  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.

Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.

On their ""specials"" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.

They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  

Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.

Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  

Absolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!","2015-04-01 15:55:54"

"m7Wxrm92EsCVAz76eZt-BQ",4,"We came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend of a friend, who loves it and has been here multiple times.  We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       

It's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack. 

We ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk, which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.  But on the whole this was a very fine meal.  Thank you!","2015-08-19 15:14:14"

"DYA4s9eupIS2SEveRLMBTg",1,"Do not stay here!  

We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.  

We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!

After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!  

She credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).

"_IwypFDgzMifpDL5AUi9TA",1,"After reading many positive reviews me and my wife decided to book two nights here to celebrate new years 2015. The room was not bad but nowhere near $179 a night. Allow me to explain. For starters the breakfast that was included in the price was pathetic. The eggs were powered, all of the food that was supposed to be hot wasn't even warm. The staff had a hard time keeping fresh silverware stocked and what little food they offered. This breakfast is not worth spending the extra money in booking this hotel. The shuttle service left us at bush gardens new years eve because they claim we didn't make reservations to and from because there shuttle bus could only hold 8 people. We went to the front desk and watched them put our name and room number on the schedule and they still were able to screw that up. I had to call the hotel at 12:20 a.m. 01--1-2015 and spoke with one of the managers about our situation being stranded after making reservations and she wasn't even apologetic. She told me to get a cab and the hotel would reimburse me. I explained to her there were no cabs in sight and she claimed there was nothing she could do. We had to walk to the hotel 1/2 mile away on new years, thanks hyatt.. 
Our bathroom was so small you couldn't even close the door without having to step into the shower. Also at 3:30 a.m. there is a very loud train that comes through and blows a very loud horn that alarmed everyone we spoke with staying at the hotel. After this experience we will Never book anything with hyatt because it was very disappointing after spending $400 for 2 nights to receive this kind of service...

After yes he offered samples of anything on the menu and recommended the most popular dishes. I was informed that almost all the dishes were similar to a stew or soup served over rice. My order was the drunk chicken with a vegetarian option for only 7.50! I was very surprised with the affordability of a full plate. Since I ordered to go I received my food in a simple styrofoam clam shell container. The presentation was pretty lackluster, but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious, that's exactly what this was!

Bottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family, a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity. 

Waitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back.

I reserved our room on line, and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. 

This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less. 

I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.

Then you go into a cool backyard patio area where there is a live band and pick a seat. For food, there is a small window to order from which is CASH ONLY.  The food is ok.

After multiple parties complained, asked to be moved, or left altogether, what did the management do? NOTHING! Just kept serving them more beer.

It's hard to justify $25-$30 dishes when the atmosphere is that of no-class dive bar. And skip the octopus. It's overcooked and rubbery.

To be fair, the oysters were excellent; hence the second star.","2013-07-12 21:30:37"
"6QFgAOe0LOGDFfuCDs4m7g",4,"I really loved Ralph's. We came here for a rehearsal dinner for a friend. The space is lovely. The balcony upstairs offers nice views of City Park. 

The staff was very good and friendly. We had a set meal. Started with some delicious gumbo. I had the red fish which was outstanding. Spicy and peppery with a not too heavy sauce. My friends found the potatoes a bit salty but I didn't notice. I also tried the shrimp dish which was excellent. We ended with a bread pudding that was a good sweet end to dinner. 

Really enjoyed Ralph's and would love to come back some time.","2017-03-15 02:47:05"

"x1jzMyQV8S-bcnf4-mE6NQ",5,"The Terrell House B&B was a fabulous experience.  I highly recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans that is looking for a more unique place to stay in a quieter part of the city.

My husband discovered Terrell House after doing a lot of B&B online searching for NOLA.  We ultimately chose them because of all the wonderful reviews and the pictures online.  The crazy part is, while everything seemed great online, none of it does it complete justice-you have to experience it for yourself!

We were greeted by Linda, the owner, upon arriving.  She gave us a brief tour, answered some of our inquisitive questions about the house, renovations, etc, and then were shown our room. 

She was very flexible with whatever time we wanted breakfast, which comes with your reservation, which we thought was quite considerate.  

Speaking of breakfast, it was just absolutely excellent both mornings.  My husband and I both commented that she could be a chef, the breakfast was that good.  It was a nice assortment of fresh fruit, cheesy grits, scones, french toast and an egg souffle type of baked dish.  We were pleasantly surprised at the delicious offerings.

We stayed in one of their King Suite rooms, and it was wonderful.  Very comfortable room with a great king bed and linens, walk in shower, working wifi, and high windows that let in great natural light.  
It was our first time staying at a B&B and we were understandably concerned the other guests could be noisy, or we'd wake people up when going/coming...not the case.  The house was pretty quiet, kept at a cool temperature (very important in the early September high humidity days!), and just overall very beautiful.  It is clear that when Linda renovated it, she didn't cut any corners--every finish and decoration is fabulous.

The only downside is grabbing a cab isn't as easy staying here as it would be if you were staying at a larger hotel on Canal Street in the French Quarter.  But, the quietness and quaint B&B experience at Terrell absolutely made up for that.

We both highly recommend Terrell House.  In fact, we hope to go back again someday if we are headed back to NOLA!","2012-09-10 16:44:58"

"nliG8Yhjims03UKGiVPNvA",1,"Easily the worst gel manicure I've ever had. I called to make an appointment, and Sue did my nails. She rushed throughout my appointment, she was rough on my nails while filing them, and the whole process was incredibly uncomfortable. Each nail ended up a different length, even after I asked her to even them out, and then she began the polish. I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn't be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way. The whole process took about 20 minutes, but here I am on day 4 after getting my nails done, and most of them have chipped with two lifting completely. 

I called today to see if I could come in to have them repair my nails and was told they would have to decide if they'd fix it or not. My gel manicures normally last between 2-3 weeks easily, so 4 days is completely unacceptable.

Total slime balls!!

Note: there are no prices listed on the truck.  (At least not during the 2nd Street Festival in NoLibs.)

My friend went there and ordered the fried chicken platter with an extra side of yams.  The guy working there told him it would be $14 for the platter and $2 for the side.  He said ok, I'll be right back and left to go pick something up really quickly.

He comes back to pick up the food and forks over a $20 bill for he order.  They take it and he asks for his change.  (Should be $4.)  Instead of giving him his change back, they tell him it is $20 - $16 for the platter and $4 for the side.  (Sudden price increase?!?!)

My friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isn't what they agreed to before and he just wants the change.  The guy refuses so my friend leaves, having paid an extra $4.

Bottom line: don't eat here!  They're dishonest and completely rude.

Oh, and on top of that, the food was bland.  Spent $20 for bland food.  Shame.

"R2M9qNXp3O5lxuBTF3jMWg",5,"Needed to find a place to dine with my folks and my aunt and uncle inside the, ""Inside"" strip (E, SL, CC), so I picked this place as most restaurants you pay close to the same price for 1 dish as you can for AYCE, and tonight was seafood night $25.95, and $3 discount for locals w/ proper ID. 

I ate at this restaurant many years ago when it first opened and it was not impressive, which was strange as we used to dine in the old buffet which was across from this one, and that was always 4 to 5 stars. 

I didn't eat here for a long time, then heard it was good again, tried it and agreed. I ate here 2 more times and both times were 4-5 stars, that is if you got the dishes that always look the best and the ones you like.

Tonight really was impressive, we were quickly sat, and served, I went out to get a plate and saw the mushroom ravioli and decide to load up, I got about 8 to 10 of them, and most places that would be all you get for $18 (probably a couple less raviolis too), but then I added tortellini, a small serving of lasagna, a loaded baked potato, fresh medium rare prime, and grabbed my seat. Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent! 

I was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp. Again, all 5 star dishes. I was very shocked to have so many different dishes on such a high level! 

Service was great, all plates quickly cleared, server was available anytime for drinks, napkins, etc. 

Last I did desert, I again went for a belly buster consisting of cheesecake, butter finger something, flan, and mint chocolate chip gelato. The gelato was the star of this show, with everything else being delicious.

Everyone who works there is so genuinely kind, and always tend to their customers. There's none of this texting behind the register crap, they are true professionals! They have a fridge full of the most beautiful, exotic flowers that you can purchase by stem. I always pick out a small bouquet for myself from there and they'll arrange it for you along with some free greens, wrap it up in this beautiful black paper and tie it off with twine some form of seasonal decoration.  

When you first walk in you'll see a bunch of arrangements that were already called in and waiting to be picked up or delivered, and they always look fresh and beautifully arranged. This place has some of the biggest roses and peonies you'll ever see, as well as some exotic flowers you just can't find anywhere else. They have vases and other small plants for sale as well, and during the summer the outside will be lined with planters and hanging ferns for you to peruse before entering the store.

"pbXbIoZwe6cEihaYqbkSHw",3,"It was a pretty cute little restaurant; the atmosphere was definitely ""neighborhood pub.""  We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  

As is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two ""stalls"" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!

When the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   

The dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.","2009-08-04 04:37:43"

I did not like the polenta fries, but the rest of the food made up for it.

"3I--zBb3ivAMYx_7500xUQ",2,"Went here a couple weeks ago with a group of 6. Waited maybe 45 mins for a table in the ramen room- no big deal, we just had drinks at the bar, which were good. I'd recommend he drink that has activated charcoal in it -- it was so good. 

Our waitress was really really nice but that's where the good things I have to say end. Most of us ordered ramen and all of the noodles were super starchy, like how they are when over-cooked. It really was not enjoyable. I didn't complain because I don't really do that, but some of my friends did and were told that's how he noodles were supposed to taste. When two in my group tried to order something else, the waitress (who was so sweet) had to come back and tell one of them that the chef didn't want to make what she ordered (an item that was on the menu) because he was pushing a different combination of fish. That was ridiculous. 

Overall my impression was that the wait staff is great, but whoever the chef is gets a 0 star review from me.

My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes, they looked nice, so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay, without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned, and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest.","2012-03-02 16:34:24"

"NP6C5ir7lMNrdZOfLXNWfA",4,"Well I read the other reviews and I have to disagree, I found the store delightful and a welcome change from typical Goodwill. I talked to the young ladies working and said what a pleasant experience it was shopping there. They told me the items offered are taken from overstock that would typically be warehoused. They do not pull from existing merchandise at GWs but from items that would be warehoused because there is no room for them in the GW store. So for those who still wish to treasure hunt at GW this does not preempt that thrill.

For me, though, I liked that the items were somewhat more selective than a typical GW. I found three shirts which on any given day I would look at 3 different GWs around town and not find one. My total cost on them was $19.25. An Old Navy, Lee Rider and Tommy Bahama ($10 of the $19). For me it was more akin to consignment shopping and priced accordingly. 

I definitely think it's worth a look on any given day. The store is very nice and it's a more pleasant shopping experience than most consignment shops.","2014-06-28 23:27:29"

I think in the 2 hours we were there, we saw our waiter three times maybe?  The food for some was hot, but for some, was luke warm, because instead of delivering the food as it was done, they waited to deliver all of our food together.  Mushroom Ravioli with short rib meat underneath that is luke warm is NOT good eats.  The waiter never asked if we wanted dessert afterward either, just brought our check that had a pre-determined 21% pretentious tipping included in it.  We didn't have a group of 30 people, and with the fact that our waiter was almost non-exsistant, was a tip that was not well earned nor deserved.  Attention to detail and customer service should match the price tag of this place, which was way overpriced for what you get. Because it's attached to the Marriot hotel chain, you'd think that the food and the service would be much higher scale to match the price tag of the food, but evidently they missed the bus on that one...","2009-10-14 04:55:05"

First, parking can be a bear.  Despite the numerous parking spaces, it's still gonna be tough getting in and out, and a spot, but trust me, you'll be fine with a little walk to the door.  Get there a little early from the lunch hour or you'll be waiting in line and you'll be looking for a spot to park your butt.

Now that you're inside, check out the menu board.  There's nothing I've tried that isn't good, and most things are great.  Fish Taco Tuesday...it should be added to the Outlook calendar as a standard reminder.  Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.  Tortas, burritos, whatever you pick, you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips, so splurge for the white, creamy goodness called queso.

"IarS92mjr7hS0epGk2NFkA",2,"This was our second trip to Yogi Elmer, NJ. Water wars is always fun ( for kids & adults) we brought a trailer w a huge water tank hitched to a pickup. There are a ton of teams that battle through the campground and at the water wars and that part is a blast!!! The pool at this facility is just screaming bacteria!!' To say it was cloudy would be an understatement! You couldn't see your hand in an inch of water! They must shock the pool each morning or evening unsure but I don't suggest adults or children to go in unless you're life goal would be to have E. coli or a skin disease. There were actual guests taking home pool samples to be tested LOL clearly this was a problem for a large # of guests! 

Bathroom cleanliness improved from last year. Check in time took some time however it was due to waivers required to be assigned by each camper. There were no waivers last year so this was new. 

They are pretty stern with quiet hour. At one point my girlfriend was told by security she ""wasn't permitted to laugh while riding her bike to the bathroom"". No golf carts after 11 and they are very strict with this rule. We had a child who was in a wheelchair with our group and we had to get into the car to take him to the bathroom in the middle of the night & early morning. From a safety stand point you would think they'd prefer you drive a golf cart vs your big truck w trailer through the park but that's just my personal opinion. 

With all that being said, kids had a blast! Bring DEET/Deep Woods bug spray bc this location has mutant Mosquitos that will make its purpose to eat your children alive given the chance.  Site 218 had sand flees, per the campers, avoid this site at all cost! Lol

The pictures of the burger look so amazing how can you not want to just eat your phone BUT the BBQ oysters at Red Fish Grill I know are amazing BUT the BBQ shrimp cooked in spices and herb butter at Deanies are so highly regarded.  SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  
Start at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? 
Now onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my ""first time""!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can't just get these flavors anywhere you know. 
And if all of the above wasn't enough like too idiots we walked to Café du Mond for coffee and beignets. 
We took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.  Try the Scallabutt (scallops fused with a hunk of Halibut).  Se bon!! and Happy eating!","2013-07-13 02:54:04"

"VLh13ctWxmHnUGlgCYvWNw",5,"I've been here twice recently to choose a wedding dress and then again to choose bridesmaid dresses with my bridal party. I made an appointment for 9am first thing in the morning because I know that these places get crowded. Both times the ladies at the check-in and register were very pleasant and we were helped right away. The woman that helped me through the entire process (Yvonne) was such a pleasure to work with and always made me feel special. From the first time I tried on a dress and was so nervous, to helping my girls with their dresses, to being there when I rang the bell and said ""yes"" to the dress. I have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend this location! Again, it's always smart to do your research and if you're going to show up on a busy day, make sure it's early  (9am right when they open is a very good idea!) and that you make an appointment!","2016-12-04 13:42:00"

Sam's very strict on the procedures but that's what makes the shop so efficient and popular. It's in downtown so you have to find parking along the street. Sushi is sooooo cheap and I can basically get full spending $3. Drinks are available; limited seating and if it's too busy he'll just tell you so and expect you to either wait half an hour or leave.

"zykXlH61a9SCIDPvCxiR8Q",5,"Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing is hands-down an amazing gym. 

I decided that my daily routine needed a little something extra to keep me motivated, while still getting in a great workout. I looked online for kickboxing classes in Santa Barbara and stumbled upon Paragon. After reading the various Yelp reviews, I decided to sign up for an orientation class, initially for the Kickboxing program. Sean Apperson, the co-owner of the gym, quickly responded to my email and worked around my full-time job to schedule a one on one class. I then expressed through email that I was also interested in the Jiu Jitsu program at Paragon, and he was extremely open to provide an introduction to both sports.

Let me start off by saying that I have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I am female who has stayed active my entire life, but starting a new sport with no previous experience can be very intimidating, especially when there are a lot of guys taking the classes. When I walked in my first day, Sean was in the midst of a training session and was rolling with a female purple belt.... it definitely intrigued me. Sean looked up from the mat and proceeded to introduce himself with a big smile on his face and right away I felt at ease. We started with an introduction class in Jiu Jitsu and my nervousness disappeared when I realized how Sean went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable. He was extremely encouraging throughout the training, we worked on basic technique and even laughed when I made a fool of myself (which happened a lot that first day). When the introduction class was over, I was so excited that I had found a new sport and signed up to join the gym right away.

After that first orientation class, I continued to attend beginner classes with nerves about how the training would go and how other athletes would perceive me. However, those nerves quickly faded after building a friendship with my fellow classmates and instructors. Everyone at the gym is extremely welcoming, approachable, and willing to work with you regardless of your level of training. 'Family' is the word that comes to mind when I think of the athletes at the gym because there is a feeling of love and respect for each other, while still pushing each other to succeed. It's a great feeling when you walk into the gym and the instructors and other athletes greet you by name and have actual conversations with you.

Also, Paragon is a very clean facility. They have a huge mat space, boxing ring, weights, cardio machines.. and they have just expanded into a bigger space, which is very exciting!! The large mat space is great for the classes and the locker rooms are clean and tidy. The shower area may be nicer than my shower at home! It's open 7 days a week and they offer classes at different times throughout the day, so you can work around your schedule.

I am so glad I joined Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing. Not only have I embarked on a new lifestyle, but have met an amazing group of people who are inspiring and fun to be around. I would definitely recommend Paragon to anyone, don't hesitate and sign up!","2013-08-15 16:20:13"

"NCtkTCOSjZgj2hPSWhfkpw",3,"Beautiful shop; hands down one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! 

We couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)

To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancée's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.

Iffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.","2017-01-28 01:00:00"

"w4uEXoZutIdWDEEZjPmSGA",2,"Ok here's the deal - I REALLY wanted to like this place, especially with all of the great reviews.  It's not close to me but I made the trip because it is supposedly great!  Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.  There were only a few customers, and the two waitresses were watching TV and barely acknowledged us.  One of them approached but didn't say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn't ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.  

We selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn't great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn't too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it's not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.  Still, the service was just plain bad and I won't be back!","2016-08-13 01:45:32"

"nVI5a76RX6h-WKCYrVOeWw",4,"The Red Owl Tavern is conveniently connected to the hotel and also open to the general public, thus providing a stylishly casual setting to enjoy a meal or cocktail. On a recent weekend trip to Philly, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, parked our car, and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events, Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink, without the stuffy hotel bar/restaurant feel.  

In a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.

Brunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.

All in all, Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events, offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.","2013-11-14 14:34:03"

"aZnLP_wR0aN2YTKtJLMnqw",1,"I wish I read these reviews before we hired Mayflower because we had a very awful experience with the company.  I do not normally write reviews that hurt companies but this experience warrants one.

My mother and father moved from St. Louis up to Chicago and my parents are older and therefore needed the help of movers.  I could not help them move because I was in middle of moving myself.  I wish I had moved at a different time because my parents could not have been in worse hands.

The caliber of employees/movers they sent to help my mom were horrible.  I will just list some key moments during the move.


-Telling my mother ""Don't you have a husband"" whenever she asked them to move something to another spot.... It was agreed upon and paid for that they would do this extra work.  My parents are older!  They are not able to move these things anymore.

-Lewd subject matters for conversation were audibly projected through the neighborhood and in front my parents.

-Argumentative when asked to move certain things to the basement.  Again, this was agreed upon to be done when Mayflower was hired.

-After getting upset about moving things to the basement, the movers proceeded to intentionally drop and slam items around the house.  Many items are now permanently damaged.


We called and complained about the movers behavior and the customer service representative told us that the mover who argued and slammed items would not be paid.  This does not really fix any problems.


I will make sure to tell people to hire anyone but Mayflower.  Thanks for making a emotional and difficult time just even more awful.","2014-03-15 01:21:02"

They had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds, also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue. 

If you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue.

This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.

"uYc70UnE0x2OnAP8TEbnaQ",3,"We stopped by here around 2:00 pm on Saturday and the place was hoppin!  We were promptly seated, so I had a few minutes to look over the place before we ordered the food.

Ambiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  

FOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.

Overall, I'm glad I came, but neither the food or ambiance did anything to scream ""Come back, Allie!""","2010-01-11 16:44:01"

We ordered two burgers, two drinks, and a 50/50 basket of fries and onion rings.  The burger: easily the tastiest burger I have found in Nashville.  Too bad they didn't have half the toppings that I requested from the menu board.  The 50/50 fry basket took 20-30 minutes to arrive.  When it did, the fries were amazing, the onion rings were colder than the soda we were drinking.  

The staff was friendly, and did their best to provide good customer service, which is why they got a second star.   

This place has the potential of being a great burger joint... just as soon as they invest heavily in bleach and Brillo pads.","2017-08-29 22:34:15"

This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini.

Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests, doors, console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders, steering column, etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible, didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash.","2014-03-14 20:04:36"

"RLrs5xYkjxvY03MmpLwv0Q",3,"I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.

Starting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.

The prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:

--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: ""Yeah, we're actually out of half and half."" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no ""I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute."" That was it. The guy behind us asked, ""is anyone going to get some more?"" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. 

--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they ""actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave"" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. 

--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). 

Jersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.","2015-11-06 14:38:52"

Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced; this was no exception. The cooking was erratic, ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special.

We ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. 

Our pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish ""Stockyard Patty"" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy. Definitely reminiscent of Lou Malnati's or Gino's East deep dish pies in Chicago. We will be back for sure!","2015-06-21 04:46:14"

"VnZk1HVpkb3Gs6Mqjfib1A",5,"This place is amazing. Everything is sooo good and I have defiantly been here enough to say I have tried almost everything on the menu. All the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control. I have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion. Some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area... Are yall serious? It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product. This place is the best donut shop around.","2015-07-28 19:00:52"

They did a great job.  One thing that I really liked about working with Wendy is that she is very responsive in her communications.  I contacted her via email and she replied the same day and in all of our back-forth emails and phone calls, I never had a communications issue with her.  I point this out because too often, service providers, who are great with their services, are not great with their communications.  Wendy and Corey were prompt, efficient, and super friendly.

"1iIuk0qKZ2FrCZi1ceP5Gw",2,"To be succinct, I'm just not a fan.

Indoor swimming pools usually give me a bad headache, but the intense headache and nausea I feel here has so far been unrivaled. 84 degrees year round? Let's try closer to 98 degrees. Once you add in all those hyperactive kids with their insanely high metabolisms packed into the small space, the heat problem gets really out of control. They do offer alcohol for the adult crowd, but I don't see how anyone could get through a drink without upchucking.

Even in the winter this place is always crowded. I wouldn't really suggest going in winter, and not just because swimming doesn't sound appealing in the winter. When the outdoor section is closed off, indoors it's slim pickings for attractions. This really is quite a small water park. As far as cleanliness is concerned, it certainly could be worse. However, I feel like the water is always a bit dingy here. You will need a shower ASAP after leaving.

If you're really hard up for entertainment, then you could always come here with small kids and they'll have a blast. That being said, there's far better water parks out there to choose from.","2017-03-15 11:28:21"

The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.

Then came the burger.

It was pretty tasty, though I'm pretty sure their secret is salt. I've definitely had better, in Nashville and elsewhere, but this one had it's own charm (read: salt). I don't always like a ton of salt, but when I do, I'd go to National Underground for a cheeseburger.","2012-07-16 15:04:30"

https://universityclub.iupui.edu/Reservations/Weekly-Menu

Excellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer, for a buffet lunch.  The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates, and also served us whenever we requested (we asked that 2 portions of the red velvet cake be split 3 ways, and the result was prompt and precise, with extra small plates).  She was cheery and interacted with us professionally, even if this wasn't (I don't think) a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys.

The menu itself feels as if it's trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget.  A couple of salad-y items including cornbread salad, a lively green (spinach) salad, and 2 other choices, plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle.  A couple of starches then proteins including a savory-sweet tofu entry--it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home, but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a ""kalbi"" meat thing which was sweet and savory, soy sauce style, and kinda clumpy, but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options (uh, fish?).  Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment, I guess.  Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated, even if the textures were not excellent.

My guess is they're operating with limited funding and staff, but there's some smart guy or gal doing the menu design, trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn't taste mass produced, but that also doesn't violate their financial dictates.  The food was tasty, not old, and satisfying without being too sweet, oily, or salty.

If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general, you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon. 

Randall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp, but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations.

The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread.

The hotels best attribute is the location. Close to historic sites, bars, restaurants.

Other than that, its a mediocre hotel at best. Not much decor, rooms are standard  size. The bed isnt too comfortable.
Small bathroom.

We did hit up the pool which is on the 4th floor. Its a 4 foot pool decent enough to hang out and take a dip.

Essentially you will be paying for the location. Parking is 36 bucks a day so be warned!

"-EeFd11mIbuOL8iQkadNIQ",4,"Wow. We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. 
Dinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. 
There are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6"" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. 
Overall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!","2018-07-17 01:43:50"

Usually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. 

After confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him ""no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?"" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. 

This was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid ""Meh"".","2010-05-14 20:35:36"

It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.

They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie.

Cold rice, chicken over cooked and dry (both my G/F's & my dish), my enchiladas was cold, red sauce tasted weird. G/F's flour tortilla was browned in cold grease as it didn't really brown, just sucked up the grease. My soda was flat, not enough carbonation to it....was also warm that the ice melted within 5 minutes of taking it to the table, so soda got watered down...

The candle center piece in the center of the table was glued down so one has to eat to the side of the table...very strange.

None of the parties involved in this project had ever designed an eternal light. We did our research, discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation. We then held our breath as Third Degree and Troco did their work.

Parking is not usually an issue unless it's peak after work hours.  Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.  Forget the quarters- this place uses laundry cards you can refill on your Visa/MasterCard.
This place puts my old laundromat to shame, and it's closer to home, cleaner, nicer and all around better (no more quarters!!!!!!)
Last wash at 9:30pm.","2015-04-28 23:04:05"

We also ordered the Butternut Rangoon, and can I just say that I could probably eat like twenty of those and be so happy with my life. They were so light and crispy, and absolutely addicting.

I ordered the Coconut Curry Noodles with a marinated egg. The the broth was so full of curry and a sweet coconut flavor, it was delicious! I also appreciated that the broth had a bit of heat to it, because the spicier the better in my opinion.The noodles were soft, and filling--so fun to slurp right up.

My mother, a regular customer, stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn't want to inconvenience customers that may enter, since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn't even even greet her.  

Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.  

8 minutes after her soup was served, and midway through eating her meal, the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.  

As she left with my kid in hand, another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn, or damaged, just wrinkly.

My mother didn't want to create a scene, so she took her wrinkly money back, paid with a credit card with no tip, ha!  

Anyways, food is okay, but it's certainly a shame both service and ownership are such wrinkle-free-money nazis.  

My tip: bring new sequential dollars bills fresh from the bank if you want to eat here.

I had the Gourmet Cheesesteak sandwich and I think after all the cheesesteak sandwiches I've had in Philly this is by far the best!

They top it with vidalia onions and Cooper American cheese, i seriously dont think anything else will top this. My wife ended up having the Filet Mignon and that was great also. She mentioned, ""oh man i forgot to ask for steak sauce"" but as soon as she cut into it the steak was so juicy she said it didn't even need any sauce.

It was a bit overwhelming, especially since it was our first time there.

Now the food. The sushi, indeed was fresh. I don't know what Alyssa was talking about. They had an okay variety, but it seemed as though that every 3 rolls had some sort of crabmeat in it. There was this triangle piece that I enjoyed. I think it had salmon in it. I had no problem with the tiny tongs for sushi. I found them to be easier than the standard tongs!

What made my day was the cold veggies. The asparagus and green beans were out of this world. Okay, so goes to a Japanese Buffet and raves about the veggies? I DO!! They were so fresh and crisp. They had a mild seasoning and sesame seeds on them. SO yummy. The chili wings were good, as was the sesame crusted tuna. I wish I had more time to look around!  I do hope to check this place out another time, maybe for dinner. The one thing I wish they had were lemon wedges. The server brought me lemon slices, which were difficult to squeeze into my dish of soy sauce. I really love the lemon, soy sauce and wasabi combo for my sushi.

As for other items - CDs/DVDs/Books/BluRays -  if the item is on sale, then it is usually a good price, and most popular items are on sale.  Any item that is not on sale (the more unusual selections, or less popular items) is usually way overpriced.

Being the largest HMV in the city, the selection is pretty good, though I do find they still fall into that ""stock only the GREATEST HITS or BEST OFs instead of back catalogue"" mentality that all chains seem to buy into.

Every year, when the WUSTL department I'm in is trying to recruit new graduate students, we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better.  The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.

The Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.

The owner's name is Mike and him and I go way back. One of the few people I still like after giving them about $5k. 

This man will tell you like it is. What you can wait to fix, what you need to fix, and when it might be time to throw in the towel (he told me if I need another big repair I should part ways with my VW).

He truly has done all the major repairs on my car.

And he is a really nice guy. He once did a free oil change because I had just spent so much. Last time? I had him replace the wires, coils, and shock plugs in my car and it was raining outside. I live about a couple miles away and Mike offered me a ride. When I turned him down he gave me his own umbrella.

"QPajyHvTmFXpccmi2Qn85Q",4,"Robert Campbell was the richest man in Missouri when he bought this house in the 1850's.  At the time, St. Louis was a very up and coming city and very much the gateway to the West.  Only three of his 13 children survived past 7, and the last one stayed in this house until he died in 1938.   Apparently the sons were all afraid to touch Mom's stuff, so it was pretty much a ready-made museum when he died.  

Still, the paint, wallpaper, etc, all needed to be restored back to their original mid-19th-centure condition, and they were able to do this perfectly because the aforementioned Mom (Virginia) kept samples in a place where they looked exactly as they did originally.  The resulting restoration is truly amazing and something every St. Louisan should make it a point to see.  The family has some great stories (one woman - TWENTY full term pregnancies).  You just have to come and hear these.   

One of the docents has a great blog, by the way, called Distilled History.  Here's a link:  http://www.distilledhistory.com/    He noted in one of his blogs you can visit this house many times and have a very different experience depending on the guide.  Some are more focused on architecture, some on the family, some on St. Louis history, so you'll get a few new storied every time.  

I would have given five stars, but we showed up ten minutes or so into the tour, missed the first room and never got back to hear about it (it was amazing).  I think I would have preferred waiting for the next tour.

The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try.

"9QouEVrRdV_6Aa_C5lAUGg",1,"first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found. 
as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. 
when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. 
when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. 
i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)

"YhM8mGVqZzBXJiwmAvgvdw",2,"Pretty average breakfast place. Much of the menu is an exact replica of Coras which is kind of boring.

First off, one of the main reasons why I gave a low rating is because of the coffee. If you want to be a breakfast/lunch ONLY restaurant, you'd better have some killer coffee. The coffee here tasted like watery Folgers.

For food, we ordered the Celine's Special and the Steak and Mushroom Eggs Benedict.

Both were cooked well. Celine's special was mostly typical breakfast food so basic, but done well.
I was expecting actual pieces of STEAK with the benedict, but it was shaved Philly steak type meat. I asked for soft poached eggs and that was exactly what I got. The hollandaise with the Benedict was pretty bland though.

The potatoes that came with each meal would be better if crispier and not soggy/floppy. They were also a little salty.

This restaurant wasn't terrible, but not nearly as good as Haps which is not far away. The service here also left something to be desired...

In Sept. 2015, I arrived at Tampa airport and took a Yellow Cab to the convention center.  The cab was a Ford Crown Victoria, probably only about 5 years old, but in quite poor mechanical condition -- basically a ""beater"".

While driving on the highway, the hood opened up and smashed into the windshield --- shattering it and blinding the driver.  He got over to shoulder, and luckily nobody hit us in the process.  His comment was interesting: ""I hate when this happens"".  After waiting 15 minutes on the shoulder, another Yellow cab showed up, already with passengers on board, and I got in.  After dropping the first passengers off at their destination, I was finally taken to the convention center.  The driver had the audacity of charging the full rate for the ride.

The incident was a direct consequence of the disrepair of the cars.  Apparently, the hood's latch had worn out, and air had gotten under it while we were at highway speeds.

Two couples who came in after us grabbed tables while their partner waited in line, so we stood holding coffee and waters for about 10 minutes right by the coffee bar.

Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again, thats never happened before either.

We were seated at about 1pm.  Drinks came pretty quickly and the server was very nice.  We ordered a Cheese Steak, Hot Roast Pork and a Rueben all with fries.  After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of ""I'm sorries"" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).

When the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.  The Rueben looked OK.

We should have checked reviews before sitting down, but it was getting late and we just wanted to catch a beer and a sandwich.","2012-10-08 16:27:16"

The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.

We shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course. Overall, the food was probably the best I have ever had in Philadelphia.

This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was ""so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?"". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it.

They let us know that our tickets included a private wine and cheese tasting event before the game.

The food served was great - hoagies made with prosciutto and good Italian salami. Everything to make your own Cheesesteaks. Hot Dogs. Chips. Delicious cookies and cupcakes. Beer, wine and soft drinks.

We had our own server and bartender. There were about three other families in the suite and there were plenty of seats and room to walk around freely. Our own bathroom which was very clean.

"VYG48wer27lsbOE51Tr93g",1,"We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.

Finally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.

I called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. 

IHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  

And since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????","2014-08-10 20:43:04"

Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.","2018-09-03 02:20:28"

They weren't playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones. Nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them. It's like an after thought..they just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look.  They knew they had a show! when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act? One cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all.

No batter not even a dusting just 12.50 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce. It's beyond laughable..where is the skill in that?

To our pleasant surprise, this place also serves some popular dishes, such as bun Bo hue (spicy noodle soup), pho, beef stew (bo kho), etc.  We ordered these dishes and they were authentic Vietnamese.   The place was spic and span, including the bathroom.  Since we were there around 11AM and probably were their first customers of the day, we don't know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day.  As for banh mi, we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches, as they were not going to be consumed right away.  The folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when we're ready to eat.  Nice touch!!!  The meats for the sandwiches at Seasons Cafe and Bakery were in good quantity, which puts the banh mi shops in Northern VA to shame.  The workers wore gloves when handling foods, and their sanitation practices seem to be better than most typical Vietnamese restaurants we've visited.

"hSNE6vdcw91BDrKiFYu0ng",3,"We have been on many cruises on other lines but, we wanted to take our Grandson on a nice trip and figured the Carnival Dream would be a good choice because of the Teen Club they offer. Booking the cruise was fairly easy. The embarkation and disembarkation went fairly well also. The cruise turned out fine for our Grandson but, there were a few things we didn't like. We knew this was going to be a younger crowd and the activities would be geared to that age group but, we were disappointed that there was not a little more available to the older folks as we noticed there were many families traveling with what looked to be older parents and grandparents. The food in the main dining rooms was fine and so was the Lido. The problem in the Lido was that they made you stand in line for everything and the lines were long and slow. The two pools were also very small for that size ship. So small that one could barely find a space to even stand in the water. The stateroom was very nice. It was a good size with a comfortable bed and a step in shower. The three ports were well chosen and there were more than adequate excursions to choose from. Overall, it was what we expected and our Grandson had a very good time which is what really matters.","2015-07-03 19:17:38"

"ehERpSrCfnmQbBplpytufQ",4,"First time back to Nashville since I was in high school, and can't believe I haven't been back sooner! Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. 

I came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalapeño ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. 

Service was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure.","2014-01-17 01:08:16"

"M8qqa7GTy1_S64uRRlnfGg",4,"Good burgers. Not the best ever, but pretty good for a restaurant burger. Extra points for the homemade buns (gluten free and vegan options), and creative choices. The fries were good. And the side salad was tasty too.

All the choices make it kind of hard to choose. I'd like to see them pare down the menu a bit, focus on 5-10 burgers that they can really do well. Some of the choices are so similar too that I don't think it'd be hard to edit  a bit.

Everyone was raving about the soda choice but no Cheerwine? WTF? Maybe Cheerwine really doesn't exist outside of the Carolinas. There was a ""Carolina"" burger on the menu (suspicious that this would really be Carolina style i.e. w/ pulled pork, vinegar sauce, and slaw on the burger, but we'll have to see) but no Cheerwine? That just doesn't seem right.

The ice cream was also delicious. I got a salted caramel shake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Every bit of it was delicious, especially the chocolate sauce. Next time might need to get a sundae just for more of that sauce. 

Bonus points for the spicy pickles.","2012-04-28 21:00:35"

I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted.

"6yqgkxJUO4_TSRC5Sjlviw",3,"If you want anything fresh, you gotta come here early, or else you're going to find yourself waiting for the pastries to bake or just have none at all.

I'm very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit. 

I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm. 

That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.

If you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ's, but if you don't mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery.","2012-05-28 23:39:44"

The price points were perfect and some locals who obviously frequent the restaurant in the food court kept singing CG's praises. Unbeknownst to them, I'd already been sold and was buying.

The bourbon chicken was extremely tasty and the portion sizes seemed like a lot when comparing to the typical amount of chicken and/or lamb over rice received at a normal NYC Halal stand.

"BnF3u7Tiep7kJYvArSLJWg",3,"Been here a few times over the years, mainly when I'm at the hotel for an event. As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.

The food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.

Bottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.","2012-10-08 19:22:15"

The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.

The customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.

That being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder.

after dinner, a friend of mine suggested ice cream, and this was the place closest to the restaurant.  the cafe area that housed the desserts was charming though in need of some refurbishing (the entire area looked worn down.)  the ice cream was so-so...i could get the same quality product at a grocery store. plus, the ice cream melted entirely too quickly. my dining companion wasn't blown away by her selection either. in addition to ice cream, there were other baked goods - apple pie, peanut butter pie, etc. but they didn't appear all that appealing (investing in nicer display cases might help.)

Then told ""well, we can't resell this because it's used"", and that's my problem??!! Your computer dosen't work, I want to return it. I told them, look, forget the $243, I'll call that a wash, I just want back the $410 I just gave you.
He ended up telling me they were going to check the computer and determine if there is a problem and let me know if they'll return my money. ......I'll keep you posted.","2014-08-25 00:36:27"
"MN2ne0v4NgGM3cqBbjggMw",4,"Don't let the location or the exterior of this little establishment fool you.  We were pleasantly surprised by how clean the place is and how modern the rooms were.  They must have recently upgraded and did some remodeling.  We had a King sized bed in our room and it was spacious and beautiful plantation shutters over their windows.  Flat screen TV, cute little decorative touches, and their bathroom was OMG!!!  I want my own home bathroom to look like that!  Beautiful granite counter-tops and granite walls in the shower.
The only negative was the strangely scheduled demolition of their parking lot on a Sunday morning at 10am.  I mean, we were up and all but we were asked to move our car and then the noise was just insane.  Thankfully we checked out that day at 11am.  Whoever scheduled that construction work must've had screw loose.  
Anyway, you won't be disappointed.  We went on Valentine's Day weekend, so prices were a bit higher.  But usually, I believe it ranges from $99-$110, which is definitely worth it!!!","2011-02-14 19:32:19"
"YTGIt2PEkfnnwfCV9vptsw",3,"Stopped in for the first time with my Friday morning breakfast club wait a little long for a table our waitress seemed to be a little overwhelmed and frazzled we finely got another women to seat us. At that point I knew we were in for a long meal, again we had to get someone's attention to refill coffee cups while waiting for our waitress to take our order Surprisingly our order came out quickly except for one order of French toast which didn't come out until three of us were half way finished with our meal which included a missing order of rye toast.
The food was okay nothing to get real excited about except the portion was more then anyone could finish, prices were about average with other breakfast restaurants but got a little more for your money. I'm not going to give it a thumbs down and will let you decide for yourself, maybe we just came at a bad time.","2018-04-27 19:04:10"
"ifxn83Aom7Np5Nyv7xKWDA",4,"I consider myself a sushi snob, and I was a bit concerned by the 3.5 star rating... and then we showed up to an empty restaurant on a Saturday night... Total red flag, but my 5 friends all wanted to stay. And I'm so glad they did! Wow!

The food was amazing! They did a great job with the chirashi, miso soup, ""monkey brains"" (fried mushrooms), hamachi nigiri, and a crazy awesome roll called the Imperial Dragon or something like that, which showed up at our table in a dragon-shaped foil wrap and ON FIRE!  It was so good that we had to order a 2nd one. 

The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is value. The sushi is more expensive than average, and the $20 chirashi only came with 6 pieces of sashimi (+2 masago and 2 crab sticks), much fewer than every other place I've been to.

The rice was great though, in spite of what some other reviews may say. And the staff and service were great too!","2017-04-30 14:52:00"

"GyB0havGf7KfHifEy2idpw",4,"My temporary apartment in Boise does not have a washer or dryer, so turned to Yelp to find one with good service and reasonable prices. A few popped up in the search and I decided to try my luck at Scrubby's. It has a fun name, after all.

My first visit was on a Wednesday night after work. Parking lot was small but there were a few spaces available. When I first entered there were several people milling about, though none approached me so I wasn't sure if any were employees. The layout was as such: dryers lined the back and left side walls, rows of washers took up the center. Folding tables were scattered between the washers and laundry carts were interspersed throughout. The walls (both interior and exterior) were decorated in whimsical paintings and neon lights in shapes of bubbles and clotheslines, which was a cute touch.

I walked to the second row and tried to find an open washer. There were plenty, but what I quickly realized was that nearly all of the $1.25 washers were ""out of order,"" while the $1.75 were all working. Convenient. I loaded up two machines. They were good sizes and easily fit all of my items. Washes took just under 30 mins, so ran over to Albertson's across the street to grab a sandwich for dinner. Once I was back, I loaded my stuff in two dryers. Cost is $0.25/7 minutes for regular size, $0.25/4 minutes for XL dryers. You have options of high, permanent press, and low heat. The regulars worked well; one dryer needed 3 cycles, the other 4. I used permanent press.

Overall a decent laundromat. They have wifi which was a nice way to kill some time waiting. It was relatively clean and odor free, though the constant barrage of flies can be really annoying. And while I wasn't approached by anyone, a girl did eventually make her way to another customer who needed help. Note: they have coin machines to make change but no ATM. Go to Albertson's for that, or come prepared with cash. Scrubby's also has a drop-and-go service that might be worth pursuing if that's your thing. And they have a loyalty card that gives you $1.50 in cash after 6 visits. Be sure to ask for one. I would use this place again, and in fact did so on a Friday afternoon with a similar experience, though with the addition of Maury paternity tests on TV. On that visit I noticed they had repaired a few of the $1.25 machines, which is the reason I bumped my original 3 star review to 4. Maybe it wasn't a scam after all.","2015-11-06 01:26:21"

"mrrLGt64csq_miPGYWIRHw",4,"I love all types of barbecue, and Judge Bean's Texas-style brisket is no exception!  Ultra yummy and tender, and really spicy too!  I have had lots of different items from the menu.  

The small brisket plate is a great option--brisket plus 2 sides--I like the cowboy beans (spicy baked beans) and slaw.  Also, the chicken quesadilla isn't what you would normally expect.  Chicken is SO spicy, and it's pulled right off the bone.  It's fantastic.  The brisket tacos are amazing, and my all-time favorite is the shrimp diablo--a shrimp stuffed into a jalapeno with cream cheese, and wrapped with bacon.  Your mouth will be on FIRE but it's totally worth it!  

I take away a star because the only location for Judge Bean's is now in Greer Stadium, where the Sounds play.  If you go to a game, be sure to go up to the restaurant on the 4th floor!  The 12th Avenue location is, sadly, closed.","2008-05-02 15:25:32"

The service was extremely slow on a pretty empty early evening week night.  (5:30).   Food was mediocre at best.  Several people in our party feels it was all microwaved.  And to have $$ for the menu price is deceiving.  Most everyone in our party thought it was way too pricey.   We are quasi-local and will find another place next time.  Ps.

Sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than you'd think, based on just looking at them. That being said, a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person, and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl, or seeking munchies elsewhere.","2016-08-13 01:12:19"

Here's what we've tried so far:
Jambalaya- awesome!  Great heat, rice consistancy was perfect (a peeve of mine).  Exactly how i like it!  Unfortunately, the hubby isn't into jambalaya, so we don't order it often.  
Red beans and rice- traditional & delicious
Brisket Gumbo- so tender, smokey, ridiculously good.  
Muffaletta- this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of NOLA.  Many places do their own variation, but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish.  I had heard that Serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and I had to try it.  Spot on!  Love it, love it!
Cafe au lait- mmmmm
Beignets- this is the only thing I'd pass on.  Very good, but made with cinnamon with isn't my thing.

They also have quite a few different fish options, which also seems weird. Salmon and swordfish are good soft. Why dehydrate them?

My biggest gripe is they don't offer samples. I get that jerky is expensive, but they'd probably make it more enticing to buy if they let you try it.","2016-09-06 13:53:45"

We ordered Mac n Cheese, Goat Cheese, Calamari, Crab Cake, and Egg Rolls.  What I love about this place is it's clear that nothing is pre-made because it arrives at our table looking fresh and alive.  Colors and aroma hit you the minute it lands on the table.  So popular with locals, the bar has 6 single diners chatting and feeling comfortable and clearly enjoying eating a meal they thought were eating alone. The overall feeling we get when we come here is - home.   Comfortable asking questions on menu and recommendations.  When paring wine with food, they are not shy in making alternative suggestions.   This alone makes us want to come back.  Service, in my opinion, is the key to forgiveness and LOYALTY.  The food has been consistent and a delight each time.   Tonight in particular if We had to pick a favorite - we can't.  We are arguing over each of our favorites and we can pick a winner among four adults.

The tacos were great, especially the handmade tortillas and the carne asada.  Poblano cilantro rice sounded wonderful but turned out to be very meh.  Calabacitas were awesome until I came upon a huge almost raw clove of garlic, a very bitter and unwelcome addition to the meal.  Really?!

While the booths felt big and open they also were not very private. There was a family nearby so I had to be careful to watch my language. I snacked on stuffed olives and deviled eggs. Did not get a full meal. Drank a tall Budweiser, and overall had fun with friends. I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete. The menu did look fascinating, and while the food was not too expensive, it did seem a bit pricy for being bar food.

Overall this is a decent sport bar and everything was A-OK. My snacks were good, service was a tad bit slow, but understandable with how crowded it was. Not going to be chompin' at the bit to come back, but I would not object to giving this place another shot!","2014-01-18 18:39:57"

Sea Bass Ceviche - was well done but did not blow my socks off.  
Platter - pork was really moist and tasty.  Chicken was on the dry side, obviously slightly overcooked.  But for a rotisserie restaurant, you should be on point with any meat that goes on.
Tamales - very tasty, more classic Mexican, more towards the type of Mexican food I prefer
Meatballs - they were ok.  Tasted like a meatball from a different country.  Not overly dry but not melt in your mouth either.

Food - not my type of Mexican.  For me average

"GOmxzUrGfC5XGIHfFa0B6Q",5,"This tour was awesome! My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. 

Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) 

At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it! 

One more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not! It's a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours, there's a TON of history to go over and if you're chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!","2016-03-07 06:16:35"

You can ask to rent a tub ( to keep it cold) and the pump.  There are deposits for these items. But will get it back once returned.  Really makes me want to look into buying a kegerartor now. I would totally keep a keg next to bed.


Not only can you choose from a great selection of beers. There are also different size kegs you could order depending on your needs.  Love this great service.  Thank you for keeping Tampa slightly tipsy total wine. Life and spirits go great together!","2016-03-18 03:04:41"

"lYBIB3aWTiKG_xLNxJhhYg",3,"Let me say right off, I'm not a bbq fan and by that I mean pork bbq. So what did I order, the chicken sandwich, of course. The buns looked yummy but I passed on them and ate the chicken and slaw from the sandwich with what I guess was their white bbq sauce (looked light orange). The chicken was on the rare side and the slaw was meh. I ordred the grit casserole and green beans for my sides. The green beans were fresh and the grits were yummy. My friends ordered the special of the day - rib sandwich and they raved about it along with the baked beans and chilled bean salad. The atmosphere is good and I loved the deck for outdoor dining. They had a great selection of sides and I'd be happy just eating them next time. I'd give it another try even though I wasn't wowed.","2012-04-28 13:51:16"
"YETqq0-HkzUCB4KngpJCXQ",4,"This place is a cafeteria diner. It reminds me of a soul food restaurant in Texas called Sweet Georgia Brown, but with better decor and facilities. You can walk through the line and select options for entree, sides and dessert. You may also order off the menu. We ordered, fried oysters, fried catfish, baked catfish, mashed potatoes, cabbage, broccoli, pasta side dish, roasted potatoes and green beans. Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish. The oyster was more battered versus breaded. If the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish, they probably would have tasted great. Dinner with one entree and 2- meat platter was $13.99 with 2 sides.

Definitely worth a visit for delicious food.","2016-01-17 20:12:47"

"FhYwjoZNkGBPGXwwUeSA5A",5,"This place is a hidden gem. I chose this restaurant based off yelp reviews. I was kind of looking for something a little different and we were celebrating baes birthday.

We went for a late dinner. It was a Monday night but I still made a 9:30 reservation. You can never be to sure. We arrived exactly at 9:30 and was seated immediately by Jeff.

We had our choice of tables. We chose a table behind the bar so we could watch the football game. Jeff came over to tell us about the late night happy hour and the dinner specials.

He was very attentive. We ordered 2 daiquiris off the happy hour menu. I had the pineapple crush I believe and bae had a strawberry margarita. 

After reviewing the menu and reading the yelp reviews we decided on an order of devil eggs, a small bowl of gumbo, crawfish spring rolls and chili wings.

The food arrived fairly quickly. It was so much food we didn't know where to start. I started with the crawfish spring rolls and be the deviled eggs. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious. I've never had crawfish before but this roll definitely did it justice.

The deviled eggs were plentiful and the presentation was beautiful.  I'm not a fan of capers so I removed them but the egg overall was very tasty.

The gumbo arrived piping hot and came with 2 slices of bread. It was so good but I had gotten full off of the spring roll and deviled egg so I only ate a couple of spoonfuls. Not to worry, bae finished the rest.

We didn't get to the wings. Jeff was nice enough to wrap them to go.

We were given the bread pudding as a birthday dessert. It arrived warm, deep fried and delicious. Maybe the best bread pudding I've had.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the area. Next time I will do brunch. Great service, food and ambiance.","2018-09-25 04:35:06"

The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue. The restaurant is clean and the service provided is that from good people, no qualms on those points.","2017-12-29 18:16:33"

Price-wise, JB's is competitive with Denny's and Cora, but I find my meals more satisfying here. And they often have specials. On Thanksgiving, I greatly enjoyed my Roast Turkey Benedict, which came with a homemade Hollandaise sauce.

They have an all-you-can-eat pasta special on Thursdays for $10. It's not Corso 32 or Cafe Amore, but you don't need a reservation and it's a good value.

We had some issues with the owners who ran the place. They weren't the best or friendliest. And the morning of check out, they were impatiently looking through windows and knocking on doors to see who was still in there. It was 8am and they were knocking on doors trying to see when we were checking out when check out was at 11. The hotel was basic but clean. Room was actually a decent size and TV was satellite with several channels. There was also an outdoor pool that the kids got in and enjoyed. Rooms have a a fridge and microwave.

"A64aOrzeu2QJKFOY2lvuyg",4,"Here's the thing, this place offers what you won't get at Applebee's or Taco Bell.  If you drive in this vicinity you'll find Don José's on one side and Taco Tico on the other. Both not Mexican. This place is as close to real Mexican food you'll find if you're walking.(as I do on my lunch break trying to avoid driving in that Williams Blvd/Veterans traffic)

I've been coming here sporadically for a few months. My advice is to order tacos but order them individually. (Like shown on the plate) Each will run about $2.50-$3.00. Unlike some of the ""hip"" mexican places you'll find in New Orleans; here you get an actual handmade corn tortilla. For that reason alone, it surpasses all those places hands down.
The four stars rating was awarded for logistical reasons. Its not ""the best Mexican food ever"" but the best in that part of the street by far. Plus they do offer some TexMex and Central American items which hinders the ""authenticity"" factor. 
There's lots of room for improvement. 
After all, this is a mom and pop restaurant, therefore it bares a Mexican theme but carry various items that can be considered otherwise. A revision of marketing plan and product review would be appropriate on the proprietor's behalf.

Their menu can be confusing, especially for gringos. Some of the dishes aren't plated inadequately. The quesadillas and burritos are real good, but are served with the most unflattering sides and it can be a tad pricey.

It's overly priced and doesn't have the best selection and employees are either rude or don't care.  Their pharmacy on the other hand is the total opposite, Don and Brooke and their staff are the most caring people ever and are always on top of everything and will do whatever they can to help anyone who comes up to them. Recently though the store made a bunch of changes. I usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons. You can always bet there's no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes. Shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own.  During the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground. They replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes, but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours, making the wait four times longer than before. If there was another place to get groceries between the Delaware memorial bridge and woodstown I would surely shop there because anything else would be better than this acme, but there isn't any other choice.","2017-01-15 04:22:30"

She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho.

"tMa58XRCtpE7N7ygYgye2A",5,"Let me start out by saying that I am a nut for good sushi. Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to, there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan, 2 are in Los Angeles, 1 is in San Francisco, 2 are in New York, and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia, a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way.
Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice, prepared properly, excellent fish, and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place.
Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry, those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats, but when the place is full, they are running around like crazy, serving food, taking orders, busing tables, and seating new parties. The wait can be long, but it is worth it.
All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi, and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna, salmon, super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues), and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture, quality, taste, and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day. 

The good food doesn't stop at the sushi, though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".

The bartenders were fun, prompt, and informative. They've got quite a few options on tap and lots of local options. They've also got cocktails and mixes. My Tom Collins was delicious and helped my success in high scores. 

They've got varieties of pinball, arcade games, and air hockey! Tons to choose from and all equally fun. Definitely will be back, especially to maintain my high score. An awesome addition to midtown!","2017-11-06 16:59:30"

The steak was about a 6 oz. ribeye which I ordered medium-rare with eggs over-easy.  Service was excellent and our meal was delivered promptly despite the fact that the restaurant and bar were at full capacity.  Biting into the steak I was amazed.  It was char-grilled to perfection, tender and sooo flavorful.  Completely unlike most breakfast steaks you get.  I daresay this steak was better than many I've had at high-end chop houses!  The eggs were perfect.  While the hashbrowns were OK, I am not a fan.  They were quartered new potatoes with a batter that was sugared.  Hashbrowns shouldn't be sweet!

It is a hang over cure for the Vanderbilt and Belmont University set so weekends after 9am will be a bear to get in. The line can stretch for hours and blocks BUT once you get in the service is fast and efficient. 

The cool factor is that I have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from Vince Gill or Kevin Costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare. 

Now the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu. I usually get a half order because I have a small appetite. My favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world. I also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top. So you mix the half melted chocolate chips with the half melted butter and then you poor a little bit of syrup on the pancakes and it's nothing short of a religious experience.

"eIgZImOC3_26t8dSJeNYKg",4,"This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. 

I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. 

My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. 

The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put.

The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said ""Food?"" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality. 

Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.

Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.

Food-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.

"cA6b5gatrU0tGvCP3iwi3g",1,"Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me ""Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card"". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a ""MAJOR"" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a ""MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a ""MAJOR"" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a ""MAJOR"" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a ""MAJOR"" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!","2012-01-03 18:20:36"

"yz06HWQXl7LLORcUjdkTRg",2,"It's really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'm still a little bitter.

So the beautiful wife and I stopped by Mojo tonight.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little ""hidden.""  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?

Wrong.

So, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.

Finally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him ""long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.""

So, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).

Anyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):

Tuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.

Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.

Garlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was ""this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.

Chicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.

It might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.

Like any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.

When we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.  Or something.

I don't think we'll be going back -- there's nothing really too exciting going on here.","2010-08-21 02:51:46"

My first visit here was love at first sight.  Before I took a bite of pizza or a sip of the finest brew served there, I was hooked.  Pinball machines.  Ms Pac Man.  You had me at hello.  And an amazing juke box to go along with it all.

So the pizza.  Folks, do not eat all day and I bet you cannot eat more than two pieces.  The any and all chicago deep dish has literally everything but the kitchen sink on it.  Beware if you do not like jalepeno peppers because they are loaded up on there.  You can create your own from an array of toppings or sometimes, I just like the cheese pizza.  Folks, I swear the cheese pizza alone must weight ten pounds.  

Excellent ambiance.  Not a place to go if you are in a hurry as you will wait at least one hour on a Chicago style pizza.  Great place to go on a Friday night.  Get caught up with friends and just sit around shooting the shit.  Excellent beer selection especially on tap.

"IoFS0qPiXFVaZNQHq6bGGQ",4,"Yuppers, I'm a fan of Old Navy. I can outfit my family for a reasonable price in fashionable clothes.

I've bought a lot of  jeans here and they have all lasted a number of years. To be honest, they've lasted a lot longer than the style. T-shirts, tanks, tops are good seasonal purchases but let's face it, Old Navy is not the place to shop when you're looking for long term wardrobe basics. Mind you, I bought my winter coat (a belted car coat) a number of years ago (5 to be exact) and I finally donated it to the Goodwill this winter. So, I guess it depends on what you buy for who long it'll last.

I've bought a lot of clothes for my daughter as well. Kids outgrow their clothes so quickly and I don't want to have to pay too much for them. But, they have a decent selection which has cute outfits. And I usually can find something in the clearance section.

Of course they place their gift item things and seasonal decor stuff at the start of the line up so when you're waiting you can't help but look at what they have. The last time I was there I came home with a few things for my daughter (sponge stamps, pads of paper, etc.) which are absolutely not necessary, but I wasn't willing to let a 2 year old throw a tantrum.","2010-05-14 14:52:36"

Positive:  it is a great place to take the kids on a hot day, my daughter loves it, parents can play with the kids, it is different and seems cleaner than a mall play place or fast food play place

Negative: it can get super busy and parents seems to have no problem not watching their kids especially older kids which means the littler kids will get trampled (my daughter was pushed down at least 3 times within an hour today)","2011-06-29 02:36:13"

"9cON6xUoZ7juujfkkYaDmw",5,"Best salon in the area! The stylists are funky, adorable, and great at what they do. I've had my hair cut here several times, had an eyebrow wax, and color, too. You're always offered a free upgrade, too, with a cut (massage, paraffin wax hand treatment, etc.) while they wash your hair. They also offer complimentary beverages and snacks, too. Both Amanda and Britta have cut and colored my hair, and I highly recommend both!

This is not a place to be rushed - if you just want to get in, cut your hair, and get out, I don't recommend this salon. They truly understand the definition of what a salon is supposed to be: a place for relaxation and pampering. Allow at least 90 minutes for your cut, but I usually make an afternoon out of it.

Be sure to make your reservation at least 1 week in advance - they get very busy and walk-ins are probably not a good idea (given that they spend a good amount of time on each client, as I mentioned above). The receptionists are very friendly and attentive (if a spot opens early, they'll call you). The line gets busy, so you might need to dial a few times, but it's so worth it.","2015-01-03 23:07:28"

"Sx6bP-BTZdw_-Si5J6hMPw",4,"If you're ever in the mood for an affordable and tasty Po'Boy in the Gentilly area, make sure you stop at Zimmers. I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.  

Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should.","2017-01-14 21:38:10"

"GV_21rCbmcNPd2GHITJhfg",1,"The ""custom"" program prescribed by the doctor is to put you on a 28-day elimination diet - eliminating eggs, dairy, sugar, grains, legumes, citrus, nightshades and a few other things (certain types of vinegar, etc). I did notice relief of symptoms such as bloating and insomnia during this phase. This phase includes a protein shake and some nutritional supplements made by Xymogen and other reputable companies. Mostly an array of vitamins and amino acids. The rest of the program is basically to recommend a Paleo-style eating program with some additional supplementation. The doctor recommended a formulation to help increase my energy levels (the testing results showed me as having severe adrenal fatigue) which he makes and is a liquid herbal tincture taken under the tongue. Except his office was out of the formulation and it took 10 days to get. When I did get it I used it as directed for the next month and I lost all the sleep benefits I had gained.  I told Dr. Nelson I felt the supplements during the elimination phase seemed to be much better for my body. He poo-pooed that idea and kept the supplements the same but reduced the dosages. I never got back to feeling as good as during the elimination diet phase and slowly lost interest in the program as it wasn't doing anything helpful and is incredibly expensive. The program cost is $6800 paid over six months. While I am glad I tried the program and found some limited success during the elimination diet it is hard to maintain that way of eating while working and traveling, etc. I will try to incorporate a mini 3-day elimination period about once a month though, and do continue to eat primarily grain-free, as I am a big believer in the benefits of avoiding all grain (and legumes). For anyone thinking about this program, in my experience it was not worth anywhere near $6800. I still have some lab tests to do to compare with my original results, but the only thing that was ""wrong"" in my initial labs was adrenal fatigue (which I wasn't surprised by). There are some things the doctor doesn't check for such as Candida and Pyroluria which I would have liked to be included. Also, they really sell the program as a concierge program and encourage you to call or email anytime with questions. My experience was that you got the information by pulling teeth if you got it at all. When I had questions about the lab tests and wondered if the lab tests had included a test for Candida I didn't get a call back from the doctor but rather a call from the office manager telling me she had spoken to the doctor and he said Candida wasn't my issue. I pressed further and she said there was no test for Candida performed in the original labs. So apparently the doctor can just size up your issues without lab tests to back it up.","2014-11-12 22:00:14"

"1sbvm_doUKF7ABuT16uqtg",1,"We came to eat last night with a pretty large party (9 people).  Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.

We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back. 

Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.

We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.

One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, ""we're busy"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.

It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions.

My first experience with a pet boarding facility was a few years back on another location, when we decided for the first time (and only time in 11 years) to take a vacation without our dog.  My parents were out of town and could not babysit, so we did the boarding thing,

After that experience, I vowed never to board my dog again, and it had nothing to do with the boarding facility.  The facility was awesome!  I paid for a private ""suite"" that had a TV tuned to Animal Planet (I am not kidding) and had a webcam so I could check up on my baby over the web.  Well, after spending most of my vacation glued to a computer screen hoping to catch glimpses of my dog doing stuff, I decided he was coming with me on every vacation from that point on.  

When they opened up a Preppy Pets near my house, i was intrigued by the suite and webcam options and we decided to check them out.  Their place is top notch, and if for whatever reason I couldn't take my dog with me, this would be the only place I'd even consider leaving him.  They also have outstanding grooming services.   McKenna is their groomer, and she has magical hands.  She makes my baby beautiful every single time!   We used to have our dog groomed at Fluffy Puppies but switched to Preppy Pets as there was a certain procedure that we needed done each grooming that Fluffy Puppies wouldn't do.  It has something to do with the anal glands, and I'll leave it at that. :)

I'm a stickler for where my dog hangs out, and in his old age on what he eats, what he wears, and what he plays with.  Preppy Pets helps me keep this promise and they are as good as it gets!","2012-02-01 17:19:40"
"qyClb0VTQqtZy-vjRHA0jQ",3,"This might be one of my favorite groupon finds.  I had a hard time deciding if this place earns three or four stars...it's kind of right in the middle.

Positives:
+Very chic interior.  I was surprised.
+Diverse menu.  I felt this was a place I could bring any of my friends and family because everyone would find something they liked...and I could still indulge in my turkish favorites.
+The appetizer/small plate list is interesting and the perfect price. Arancini was delicious.  
+Accessible wine list.  Bottles were largely $30 or under.  I'm no wine expert but I really enjoyed the pinot noir they had.  
+ I was not expecting the food to be so well plated at this price point.  Felt fancier than what we were paying.  
+ My husband really enjoyed the Imam Bayildi
+ Great HH specials advertised (we did not partake) 

Needs Improvement:
- My kofte was a bit dry.  If I hadn't gone to Aya Sofia 2 weeks prior, I might've been thrilled just to have the option...but I was still a little disappointed.  It was well seasoned which helped make up for the dryness. 
- It seemed like every single person in this place was involved in serving us.  Which is a fine approach...except it kind of seemed like nobody knew exactly who should be taking our order.

However, the workers behind the counter were poised and courteous despite the onslaught. The great staff stood out in other areas as well! In the wine room and the cheese room I was helped by two men who were eager to answer questions, hold a conversation about their respective areas, and make me feel great even though I had little knowledge. I never felt rushed and I felt well-taken care of even though I was young and I definitely don't look rich. 
Great place. When I am back in town I will definitely keep going for the section of foods and service. 

Deli food: 4/5- Great for how inexpensive and mass made it is. Nothing really made me excited but it all tasted good. 
Gelato: 4/5- Small varieties but very tasty. 
Cheese: 5/5 - There's so much cheese! And the guy behind the counter really knows his stuff and will help you understand the differences between all those stinky rinds!
Wine: 5/5- Good selection and multiple staff members seemed to know what they were talking about, including the location and story of many wineries.

A friend of mine, and the only one amongst us from Louisiana, responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression. 
We get seated, the manager tells us our server is going to be male, a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience, even if you're having a bad day, you don't show it or just come right out and say it. 
The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer, the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed. 
For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye, it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was ""blackened"" was because it was burnt. My fiancé got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread.

I did just have a cool temp burger and nuggets, however when i brought it the their attention, they immediately made sure i got fresh 'hot and juicy' food. Not a big deal but does need patience. 
Since i ate inside it was not that big a deal, if i went to the drive through and then hopped on the Turnpike before i took a bite, i would be very upset.

"QxksCUZv1QiNOzyPezo70w",5,"For context, I've previously always been, somewhat to my embarrassment, generally more fond of fancy/trendy donuts (do-rite in Chicago, sidecar in LA, etc) than your mom-and-pop style donut. Always thought the high-quality ingredients and inspired flavor combinations made the calories more worth it. 

St. Louis is an anomaly. The hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment. Sorry Strange, your toppings are decent, but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick. Sorry Vincent Van Doughnut...actually, I'm not sorry - you should be sorry for selling me that chocolate-coffee abomination. That's the first donut I ever left unfinished. It's literally sprinkled with coffee grounds. It would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that, but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate.

Thankfully, the anomaly works both ways. This homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff, for insanely low prices. Chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheap-donut-chocolate. Blueberry cakes are light, fresh, and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying. All worth coming back for, but oh, the apple fritters. Deep fried perfection.

"Y-nRM21X885k9gbt-oNajA",3,"First, pork was super dry last night. Surprising since it was a busy, holiday weekend so you'd think they be turning out lots of fresh pork instead of a product that tasted like it had been sitting under a dry heat lamp for hours. However, wings were pretty darn tasty. A touch under done but worth coming back for. Ribs and pork are dead to me though.

The biggest disappointment about our recent visit was the way the ""wait in line, order, get your number and sit down"" process soooo doesn't work at this place. To be fair, it's not Mr. Edley's fault that the douchebag hipsters and self absorbed yuppie parents don't have enough common sense or courtesy to not sit down before they've ordered and obtained a number but seriously, PUT UP SOME SIGNS or have the bus people and manager politely ask people who have rudely tied up a table (or 3) while their party waits to get up. When I suggested to the cashier that they might have an issue this past Saturday, she said they ""don't allow that"" but then nobody told the family of 8 who committed this major foul to get up while we looked around for a place to sit (after ordering, of course). 

My thoughts for Edley's 1) your food quality is slipping 2) your customers apparently need to be taught that sitting down before ordering throws the whole balance of your system off--find a way to tell them.

P.S. If you're a party of 10 and looking to sit together on their patio on a busy night, go somewhere else unless you're prepared to respect the system and try your luck for a table...AFTER YOU'VE ORDERED!","2014-05-26 01:19:47"

The place is warm and very clean with booth seating on either side. Pictures of Morocco and other places in North Africa and/or the Middle East are on the wall. Sometimes there's soccer on the TV, sometimes not. 

I've had the lamb ketban and the schawarma platters. The lamb meat in the lamb ketban was succulent, moist and full of flavor. You could tell they spent time spicing the meat. The schawarma was also tender and had some flavor, though I didn't enjoy it as much as the lamb.

Both platters came with a tomato and cucumber salad with mint on it that was very tasty. The yellow/saffron rice was also cooked just right. The olives that come with it are interesting. Evidently the owner soaks them in spices and garlic in some type of process. You may or may not like it depending on how much you like the spices present. The platters also come with your choice of appetizer. I've had the hummus twice and both times it was lick your plate good. The pita bread is a little on the dry side but otherwise ok.

I have never found a place where even the pizza wasn't safe - I felt they didn't have time for me or my daughter. Very disappointing for a top rated children's museum. We have visited The Indy Zoo, the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Bellaboo's, Disney World, and Sea World - all provide allergen menus and help assist with concerns for cross-contamination. Please consider an allergen menu or ingredient list so parents, kids, and adults with food allergies can enjoy a full day at the museum. Food allergies are on the rise and 5%+ of kids and 2% of adults have food allergies. On another note, the new Playscape was great except the ball exhibit really needs to be tweeked - a lot of the balls fell off of the ramps or wouldn't go up the spirals - that was very frustrating.

Gabe and I went here at his suggestion for his ""better late than never"" birthday dinner. One of the few times I'm allowed to pick up the tab ;)
He opted for beer and I opted for wine. Both enjoyable. He got the special which was some kind of sweet and spicy fried chicken. I got the shrimp and grits. The portions were small for those used to large meals but for us, it was perfect. Left room for more beer later. 
Atmosphere was dark and cozy. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. Made reservations, arrived early and seated immediately. 
So about those chairs.... They're super cute but as I leaned over to grabbed my card that leaped off the table, I went down sloooowly. It was funny actually. A manager ran up to see if I was ok. Between my giggles, I told her ""yes"". Glad it wasn't a first date lol. 
So was it the wine that caused my graceful descend or the unsteady chair? Let's just say, not 5 mins later, a man at another table fell too....hahaha! I'm blaming the chairs.","2013-07-13 02:22:25"

"DuIyj11GkkrUxzFCLSZlww",1,"I love 312 deep dish pizza. So much so, that the restaurant was on the short list of places I wanted to go during my last week in Nashville. I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day. 

We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).

All in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.

TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.","2015-08-30 19:15:36"

I'm just another fan dropping a review or....""revamped"" review in my case, and just letting the Yelpdom know.....The quality of the food you get here for the price is ""Asinine"" some would even say ""Bananas"" but all in the best of ways. Here we go..

The Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!

They have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from..
Chicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general ""Diner"" style motif going on here. 

The service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say ""suck it up"" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.

When you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..

Split Pea
Clam Chowder
Chicken Noodle

You could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. 

In closing, ""All hands on Deck"" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you ""Must"" visit when you are out here in Reno. I always end up meeting cool people in here and overall just enjoying the food here. This place is the true star of the Club Cal Neva, and I don't see this place losing it's shine anytime soon.

We generally get a vegetarian pizza loaded but even with all those veggies, there still isn't much taste.
We also generally get a side salad with a dressing (dressings seemed to have come out of a can). But even the salads (lettuce and tomatoes) have no spices on them. This is suppose to be a pizza restaurant. Where are the Italian spices?","2015-08-30 18:58:07"

"DEybT0YkoxtPe2VUlIuOsw",4,"Great waxing estheticians at this spa! I just moved to Philadelphia a few months ago and I've had a hard time finding good waxing salons that provide services at a reasonable price. Most places have a back curtain or a back room which is not private enough for body waxes. This is why I've never felt comfortable in other salons. 
This salon/spa is different! The main floor is designated for manicures and pedicures, chair massages and facial waxing. The upstairs is the spa area where there is a relaxing waiting area and  private rooms. The light is dim and it is a very welcoming environment. I had a full arm and bikini wax, and not only was I happy with the results but I was even able to close my eyes and relax during my procedures. Every detail is taken care of.

The chow fun was good. No complaints there.

The smoothie was terrible. Either the mango that they used was not ripe or they used mango juice instead of real fruit. 0/10, would not recommend.","2016-08-13 00:11:33"

"ITgoFkVkWb83zw3v4Jq-xw",2,"This place could have a lot of potential under the right management and with some renovations.  Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.

It is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  

The overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  

The food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  

With the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  

The spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  

If I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.","2015-05-26 16:18:49"

My only real complaint is that during some hours, this place is PACKED and so that may put a kink in your plans if you wanted to meet someone there for a meeting. Also wifi is sometimes touch and go.

"tPOey7vqiGEazYB96dNccA",4,"Couple of notable impressions:

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.","2014-01-17 21:10:17"

"nVOxcQ_z2HhSt_oYGbVfig",4,"Located at the Farmers Market in the French Market district. You basically order at the counter then pick up your food. There are a few patio tables/chairs where you can dine in as well.

Definitely get the peel and eat boiled crawfish and bbq shrimp!!! Freshest crawfish I've ever had and doesn't have an aftertaste that lingers. If you've never had crawfish, make sure you research how to open 'em up before you try 'em cause you'll be missing out. These crawdaddies are cooked with some vegetables (celery and onions) and it does have about a 6/10 spice to it; so I wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice very well. I believe the market price was $12/lb so a bit pricier than other crawfish joints in NOLA. The BBQ boiled shrimp was very tasty as well! It came with bread drenched in garlic butter. My boyfriend and I also shared the crawfish beignets which were okay, it felt like they were sitting out for awhile waiting to be picked. These crawfish beignets resembles a hush puppy with a few pieces of crawfish tails inside. I would probably pass on them next time. Make sure to order yourself a side of fries too to sorta help fill your tummy up!

If you're trying out the peel and eat, make sure to bring some wet wipes/hand sanitizer to use right after. Restrooms are a bit tricky to locate. I believe the closest restroom would be in the flea market area of the French Market District.","2018-06-09 01:52:26"

"WGSsy5vzWTyFlqfq0waqLw",2,"We went here for dinner and it was fairly busy, although reservations were not necessary.  Inside it looks more of a classy place.  But sadly, that was the best part of our experience.   Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   

As for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.

The ""whole shabang"" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.

I think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!

My advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.

My friend enjoyed her meal as well, although, we both felt that it was a little too expensive and the parking lot is VERY small. 

The only downfall was the dessert, which was honestly terrible. I got the chocolate cake thing. I can't remember its official name but it was recommended by the waitress and it was honestly just terrible. The cake had obviously been microwaved and it was bland, which was a feat to suck the flavor out of chocolate cake. It had a scoop of ice cream on the side which tasted like it was a bit frost bitten and actually had chunks of ice in it. Not great.

On the bright side, the place is beautiful on the inside and the waitress was really friendly. We had the same girl both times we were there and I liked her and can overlook the poor dessert recommendation.

I'd give Smith's 4 stars, but the service was not the best.  We called in advance to make reservations for a group of 7 and were told they didn't take reservations.  When we arrived, the first thing we were asked was if we had resevations.  What???  Annoying.  We ended up sitting and waiting, getting very little updates from the hostess.  

Not the best service, but I'd go again for the food.","2014-01-17 21:44:32"

"wtmcUcibLjqk36XJQMoNRA",5,"Well, I hope I don't offend the BBQ police with this review....but I didn't order ANY BBQ here....what I did order was, possibly, the best hot chicken sandwich I have ever had....no small feat in a town that DOMINATES the world of hot chicken.

I was convinced to try out Edley's when a friend in town billed it as 'unique and gourmet BBQ'....OK, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but what the hell, I'll give it a whirl!  I like good BBQ, but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken, and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So, I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?), I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn, I AM a brave man.

We sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it, I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken, but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy, I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side, but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.  

Anyway, I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food, full bar, nice set up inside, and a great patio as well.  Throw a great location on top of that, and what else could you ask for?","2015-07-04 02:19:18"

We ordered seafood and chicken po-boys and a bowl of seafood gumbo. The food was good but overall very very salty and the gumbo was the size of a cup and overpriced ($7.95).

Upon walking into the restaurant, I stood by the counter/register and waited for someone to come to the front.  A woman walked up from the back of the place and said, ""ya"".  I asked for a to-go menu, received one and left.  I perused the menu in the car and noticed they seen to be priced higher than many other Indian places in the Nashville area.  

Sorry, but ""ya"" is not how I prefer to be greeted.  Like I said, I have not eaten at this restaurant.  After this brief encounter, I will not do so.

We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip.

They are even having a special deal for Valentine's Day where it's only 14$ to adopt compared to 50$. This is HUGE because it meant we can get both of the kitties who are the same litter and came in together.

And the price-to-portion-size ratio is awesome.
For eight bucks I get a Styrofoam container with the meal I mentioned earlier that is so full it will barely close.  
The young lady who prepared our order on my most recent visit had to force the boxes closed and double bag them just so we could get them home without them bursting open.  And we ordered the SMALL portions.

Now, as with any restaurant with good food it goes without saying that word travels.  As a result this place is always packed. ALWAYS. 
The line remains at two lengths: at the door or out the door.  So if you're impatient or adhering to the ""fast food"" mentality when it comes to restaurants, you may want to go elsewhere.

Service: Meh. everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland. 

Seating: I sat at the counter because I dislike communal seating unless I'm at a bar. I recommend this option if you don't want to sit near someone else's hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic.

Food: Decent. The pizza (I got the Crudo) was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm. Other then that, the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.

It isn't like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I've been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn't take 3 hours.  

Now that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  

At lunch, I normally get the ""Goodness"" which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don't bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)

I've gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  

My husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.

The vietnamese crepe was AWFUL.  I'm not sure if it is the way it was prepared or if I just hate Vietnamese crepes.  It was like an undercooked eggy tasting omelet with tons of cold bean sprouts and thinly sliced cold shrimp and other grossness.  This could have been a delicious example of a Vietnamese crepe, I just might not like them...  - $5

We also ordered pork egg rolls.  Ok.

I would go back to try other menu items.","2014-05-08 04:57:20"

And do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  Oh yeah, I forgot it's every girls dream to sit at a table of fat, chicken wing grease covered, over 40, balding, married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  But you're the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.

Not to mention I also had 2 mattress sets, a room of carpet, a broken sofa AND an old door that needed to be dumped. 

Called Tobey's and was asked to text the information about my job to them.  Scheduled an appointment on my day off. They arrived a little after 9am and left around 1130 and did a great job of hauling off everything! What a weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about all of that crap.

"NlFHjxl5vmiNe0In4DaSlw",4,"I've been here a few times and always have the same server he is very nice but there are a few things to iron out here: I am a hardcore fried chimichanga girl love them and take tried many different kinds but they put beans in there's BEANS!!!? The best part about a chimi is that buttery n flaky crust on the tortilla and the moist shredded chicken with a delicious portion of peppers which sadly they do not ad just beans and chicken, one thing that really pressed my buttons was the first time I came they knocked over my cup when the set down my plate and completely soaked my little sisters food in tea and proceeded to charge us for another meal! But on to the good why them deserve 4 stars. After having a not so great chimi I decided to try my own take and orders a side of grilled shrimp, lettuce, queso, tortillas and rice. I'm picky at times so I opted for a make my own kind of taco and for 8$ for rather large pieces of shrimp that come with 13 of those yummy boys I'm in heaven!

"RPFO-HPaV9wuV_4rQLQpeA",1,"I'm writing this review because somebody has to.

Surrey's is allegedly the best breakfast in New Orleans. Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life.

I don't understand, and I never will.

I've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year, and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions, and they have all, to a man, in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know, ""Hey, have you ever eaten at Surrey's?"" They always reply, ""I hate that place. The food is awful.""

I will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13.

I actually don't drink liquor, so village WHISKEY may seem like an odd choice of locations, but they have a fantastic beer selection too. Honestly, I stopped here because it's a Garces joint and I would drink toilet water if he put it in a bowl with some cilantro. Plus, my boyfriend loves their whiskeys. And so do the other guests, which makes this place so fun: the last time we were there we ended up joining booths with our neighbors so that we could all talk about the restaurant and their liquor choices. It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd.

Food wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on... duck. fat. french. fries.

My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  

Prices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.

One last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere.","2013-05-07 19:58:15"

They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by.

Edited to add: I let the kids get a few tokens from the token machine on the way out. The machine spit out tokens that the games wouldn't take and management wouldn't give us new ones saying that those aren't jungle wonder tokens. (Even though I got them from the machine in jungle wonder.)

"_xUhbydbVEspF4WrhToCzw",3,"The food here was good, but nowhere near competes with other restaurants in the French Quarter. We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else. 

It's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.

We sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.

I ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning. 

Our waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square.

We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered, and I was not really impressed by them, either. Also of note, almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill, but after the third course, that was a lot of dill. Overall, it was a good meal.

"Vm34LhLhglJslQtRHzFLnQ",4,"Gluten free pasta...I had to try. Plus, 1/2 price wine Mon-Thurs did not disappoint.  The selection was just right.

We found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.

To start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.

Next I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  

Tasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!

My dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. 

Be prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)

Not every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).

I believe we will return to try more items on their menu.","2018-04-27 19:04:21"

Atmosphere: clean, efficient, but classy. Good quality seating. Comfortable. 

Food: Those cooks know what they are doing. The food for breakfast and lunch is astounding. The prices seem high-ish, but actually, you get a lot of food that fills you just to the brink of super-fullness.

Coffee: they serve French Truck coffee here. Great iced coffee! Meh iced latte, at least for a large. Too much milk. Gimme more of that espresso!

Speed: great on weekdays! Weekends are another matter for me; there is always a line out of the door! This is their fault, as the great food and customer service keeps people coming back.

So I'm giving it a 4 star because these people have pushed it to the very point of being as Cajun/NOLA/Southern as they can with the demographic thats around. Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come. So I give them a thumps up for making it as close as Carmel-Indy will allow to stay in business.

Now the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.

"PywdD8omdRSNOf_jufGysQ",3,"I originally gave b.good a 4 star review and it was basically: If you're in the market for a burger, salad, or kale/quinoa bowl that's made with real & not-processed ingredients, go to b.good. I also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didn't have HFCS or artificial ingredients. I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.

I have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.

As far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.","2014-12-18 02:40:30"

"jxt9SApvbiElVf4GmGam5w",5,"If you're reading this review you're most likely one of the following: somewhat new to the Pinellas County area, a snowbird looking for Honda service, new to the world of Honda, or you broke up with Honda years ago and realized it's time to go back to the best car you've probably ever owned...

Whatever the case, you're looking to avoid the trek into Tampa, right? This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. 

From Service to Sales, They're There to Help.
Ironically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.

Honda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.

No Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.
Karen handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. 

Justin Simplifies the Finance Process
You've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...

Ready to Rock and Roll
Regardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. 

Overall Positive Customer Experience 
We left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. 

Sweet Sidenote
Crown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit. Loved this!","2018-01-21 20:34:50"

The pasta was very good and the sauce seemed to taste as though it was from scratch.  The only downside was the shrimp on the dish was shell on.  Its the first time I've had it with the shell on.

You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. 

We made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an ""early lunch"" slash ""snack"". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.

The quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!

It was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.

My wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist.

I bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread I have ever eaten. The selection is amazing, you will find things from all over the world. They get rare and unusual items so it costs more. 

I don't think AJs is snobby. I did get some weird looks from the employees when I showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes, but I know what I want there and get great quality things that go into my body. And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I'd rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ's is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!

I probably can't or won't shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff. But for specialty items and rarer beers and things, this is the place. It's also fun to browse. Totally good times.","2011-08-26 01:34:01"

Our visit to Aldine satisfied 2.5 of these five stars - great tastes and an eclectic ambiance.

Their beer list was ok. The service was sterile and perfunctory. And, dinner for two was $135 before tip. The $25-26 entries were delicious and reminded us of tapas - however, Aldine is not a tapas restaurant.

Make sure to make it up to the view and climb the stairs  (resist the urge to take the elevator) to watch  the clock/bell at work. The view, although not super high, is breathtaking and gives you a good look at the beauty of Santa Barbara.

We saw high schoolers doing some sort of club activity here (maybe MUN?) but that didn't stop us from enjoying the courthouse. You are free to walk he grounds--no intrusive security guards or large tour groups. It didn't feel so touristy/museum-y either which for some reason made me appreciate the experience all the more.

The best part of all--it's free! You won't need to set aside a ton of time here (maybe 30-45 min). There's ample street parking around the courthouse, at least on a weekend so get over here stat!","2016-01-18 00:15:33"

"-vIuycScTA7SVwHDi1ENeg",4,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but have decided to go with the more generous offering?  Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  
Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.
An early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. 
Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected ""spicy"" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.
I'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with ""medium"" spiciness!","2011-02-14 18:01:48"

The Shrimp Taco is my favorite, along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)... 

My friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.

I just had their Beefy Crunch Burrito, XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito, and a Meximelt. I shudder to think how may Weight Watchers points I just ate.  But it was goooood.  I hadn't been at this particular Taco Bell in a long time.  It's nice and clean, service was fast and the staff behind the counter very courteous.  

I'm not going to debate the merits of Taco Bell food as Mexican food.  I've had authentic Mexican food, and this is obviously not it.  If you are looking for authenticity, something like Miguel's or Carmelita's or Vallarta's is a lot closer.

They do have some healthy options, which I recall from a while back and was nice to see them again.  Their ""Fresco"" items basically remove the cheese and sour cream and stick to salsa and lettuce as toppings.  It is actually possible to eat a couple of Fresco Tacos and stick to a strict Weight Watchers diet.

You see most everything that will teach you about the desert within a mile of the visitor center. If you can get off on a trail, so much the better! 

I see that many people recommend the tram. I don't. The cost is high for what you get, now $10 per person. The comments from the drivers are seldom insightful. And, worst, the trams are loud and dirty, spewing pollutants. The Forest Service has shown no leadership in getting the company to convert to clean fuels. The company shows no interest in doing so. As a result, they degrade what they purport to show off. I would suggest the tram only if you are truly unable to walk.","2015-10-17 04:18:28"

My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild, even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat, the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis, I've had the mango, rose, and mint - all I would recommend.","2016-07-14 21:10:35"

"NPg5m9MvZfT091AA5h8aCA",2,"Visited on a weekday at lunchtime, service was good but waitress talked so fast in reciting the specials you could barely understand her.  It wasn't busy so I don't know why she felt the need to talk so fast.  Decor was very nice.  Food was good BUT.....calamari was underseasoned and could have stood a minute or so more in the fryer, they were a little pale.  We ordered a panzanella salad to share, we were both excited to get it based on its description on the menu and also because we both love a good panzanella.  This was not panzanella, it was a field green salad with a few bread cubes in it.  Very disappointing since the menu made it sound like a true panzanella.  When we told the waitress and who we thought was the manager ( she just nicely happened to stop by and chat) she said people had complained before because the salad had come to them and it was all bread cubes with other ingredients and no salad greens,....DUH! That's panzanella!  How about educating people on what a proper dish is don't dumb it down! We ordered the pizza , one mushroom pizza with truffle oil, that was divine,  great crust etc.  we also ordered the hot pepper pizza which was disappointing.  The crust was great but it was really just a cheese pizza with pepperoncini on it.  We shared a lemon dessert that was quite good.  The cost for lunch was somewhat expensive I thought. One appetizer, one salad, two pizzas and one dessert, no drinks, just water and the Bill with tip was $52.  Might go back and just get pizza to go next time.  It's tough in PA to get a good crust and they do have a really good one here.","2013-11-14 04:16:03"

"yXKPeaUKoiMvZpNNUc3SEg",2,"Being that I was looking for a place to have some wings and beer while watching the Sugar Bowl with some fellow Gator fans, I decided to check out Gator's Dockside (my first time at this location). 

I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was all-you-can-eat wing Wednesday, but immediately disappointed it only included the breaded boneless wings. I had one serving of 10 at the start of the game -- hot garlic -- and became full because of how thick the breading was. I asked for a side of ranch when ordering, but I never received it. I like my ranch dressing, especially if I'm eating chunks of breading. 

To wash the ""wings"" down, I decided to take advantage of the 99 cent per 10-ounce mug of Bull Brew draft beer, which wasn't anything special but pretty good for a cheap and local beer (USF). 

The service at the bar started out fine. I was asked multiple times if I wanted to order another plate of wings or if I needed another beer. Two hours went by, and when I was finally ready to take advantage of my all-you-can-eat deal, the bartenders were no where to be found. They all seemed busy trying to clean and close -- even though it was still early -- rather than serving their customers. 

After 10 minutes of waiting - and almost missing the 11 p.m. cutoff deadline for the wing deal - I finally got the attention of a bus person and ordered a serving of the honey garlic wings. Instead of getting the serving of 10 I received before, I got six. It could be because I was fuming at how bad of a beating the Gators were getting from the Louisville Cardinals, but my wings were barely warm. And yet again, they forgot to add my side of ranch I made sure to order. 

Maybe I ordered them too late? Or maybe I waited too long to get service? 

Either way, I wasn't thrilled about finishing my second serving of wings. 

At this point I couldn't take it anymore -- the game or the wings -- so I asked for my check. Luckily my beers were cheap, so my bill added up to exactly $20 including tip ($11.99 for the all-you-can-eat wings plus the 99 cent beers). Not a bad price to pay to sit at the bar for almost three hours. 

My experience could have been much better, though. Even if the Gators won. 

If you're going to offer all-you-can-eat wings, do it the right way.","2013-01-03 05:58:49"

"rZ_6oX2QrxfMgAUg2L_Ndg",4,"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou!  I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it.  I've gone for all different types of visits.  I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration.  This place has it all.  

I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi.  The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want.  I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have.  Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money.  In addition there is a lot of space to sit.  Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.

While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety.  They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day.  I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive.  Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails.  For the most part, everything is modestly priced.  

This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers.  It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue.  I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend.  The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar.  The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs.  It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor.  Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime.  

Overall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.  It's not usually too crowded during the day and you could have free run of the place depending on when you go!","2013-02-21 21:31:38"

I decided to go with the sundae pudding, which was so tasty! It wasn't overly sweet which was perfect for me. I wish I lived in Philly so I could come here all the time!

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said, ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.","2018-09-14 14:54:24"

Their harmonies were scrumptious leaving the audience wanting more! They sang, had audience banter, and entertained for about an hour! It was delightful! It was wonderful to hear all the brothers take the lead on various songs! The bad news was the meal prior! The mushroom soup was good, the rest was downhill! The small crab cake -most at the table didn't eat. The chicken breast was okay as were the mashed potatoes! Oddly the rolls they served with the meal were sweet with honey on them. Not a fan! The worst part was the service! They were in such a hurry they were literally taking plates before folks were through! Final thoughts-the show is worth it  to hear the brothers perform, cut the meal and cut the price and the result will be happier customers!","2016-12-04 05:24:37"
"kMe2VH1uNJIXLYsmAxCMnw",5,"""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels""...except for Huddles.  

This place is great!  Cheap...no.  Delicious...yes.  I don't eat ice cream or frozen yogurt on a daily basis so I'm okay with the splurge.  

I love all the different flavors of fro yo that they have!!  Every time I go there is something different and I can always find something that I want.  I wish I could remember all the flavors I've had but it's like every time I take a spoonful, I black out from the heavenly taste of it.  

I like the fact that they tell you which ones are low fat and which ones are fat free.  It's definitely hard to resist not getting a mass quantity since the cups are so big but I'm getting better at the portion control.  It's just so easy!  

The punch cards are awesome and I love that they let the 3 of us who always go together always punch the same card all at a once.  Some places make you have a card per person and I hate that.  

I'm already a Colts fan but I like to think that every trip to Huddles is just another way to show my love to the team.","2012-03-01 22:36:38"

"ETSeSPnej6l29ASsPvU0Jw",4,"This place has a very unique feel. We nearly missed it on our walk to dinner; there's no real label on the corner restaurant.  

They have an eccentric mix of IPA's and Pale Ales. The menu is very interesting as well; their buffalo wings and the cavetelli appetizer were both amazing..the cavetelli was served al dente with amazing flavor. I had the skate for my dinner, which was probably the most delicious fish I've had in as long as I can remember. 

They are known for their burgers, which were very good as well. They are often compared to Village Whiskey's burger, and sadly I don't think they are quite on par, but still very good.

This place is on the pricier side, but the ambiance on a Saturday night is a mixed crowd; noisy and full of energy. Nicely done!","2012-04-29 16:16:09"

I've had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren't authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful.

We had perfect views the fireworks at midnight from the deck and all the windows. The food was exceptional (buffet and passed hors d'oeuvres) and the waitstaff all went above and beyond.

So don't get me wrong, but as a gluten-free person, it's a real dissapointment. 7 out of 10 dishes have gluten (mostly or breadcrumbs or soy sauce) that can't be removed from the dish. They also do not have glutenfree bread to start off the meal. Nowadays alternatives are so easy to find by using tamari sauce or amino acids instead of soy sauce. Even the redwine sauce had gluten, it is very easy to make that without gluten.

"GJFn9e5GbLLky_OcoCl44A",4,"This restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve - which is wonderful! The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! 

Our entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.

All in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back.","2015-05-13 01:02:39"

"aQAIoNa7AhR5tZ92pqGPug",4,"Better than any of the Thai I have tried in or around downtown St Louis or Grand!

I'll gladly make the trek from south city to O'Fallon to get this delicious, superior and value Thai.

Having been twice, I am ashamed to admit that I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles so I have had that each visit, albeit once chicken and once pork.

The appetizers are delicious.  Have tried the spring rolls, chicken satay and chicken pot-stickers and they were all satisfying.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a ""sinus opening experience"" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being ""not fresh"" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It's where I'll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I'll go for takeout when the urge hits.

It is right next to where H-Mart  begins, across from Paris Baguette.They have an incredible selection of delicious hot and cold prepared foods.Outstanding choices to die for are the spicy chicken pieces(breast) w/sweet & sour sauce, wings(rival Cafe Soho, but cheaper), and the spicy blue  crab soup.Everything I have tried here has been nothing short of fresh and delicious. Other items you can't go wrong with are the Soft Tofu Seafood Soup, japchae,(although I prefer the H-mart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same price),the fried squid,gimbap, box lunches, mak kimchi,and savory pancakes.

Their prices are incredibly reasonable with most things $5-$6. The box lunches are $6 and I had an amazing one last week consisting of Beef Bulgogi, Rice, Kimchi, Japchae, 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that I had no idea what it was 'cept it was incredible! I think it was some type of deep-fried flour-type ball of goodness.I'm still dreaming of that lunch. Not all items are always available. There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.

I always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it. You know it's special when folks come from out of state to buy it.

Well, if you're like me.. that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome take-out, you just order from both places so you don't miss out! We ordered take-out from V Street, then headed next door to Wiz Kid, where I ordered the WK philly (the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak). We were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at Wiz Kid and eat our food there. The WK philly was ready under 10 minutes, and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies. I loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options. I went with the spicy and my mom had the regular. We split the hoagie and were both BLOWN away by the flavor. This was the best cheese steak I've ever had.

"Y24WZxC5IciPEXxsrhYuKw",4,"Took my family (party of 6 - kids aged 16,10,9, & 30 months) for the day (July 3rd, a Sunday). If you are uncomfortable in a diversely ethnic and racial environment than this place isn't for you. We have a blended family (Caucasian and Latino) and are from Brooklyn, Queens, and the Lower East Side & Harlem. We felt as if we were in our normal elements around the way and not 2 hours away from home in an otherwise non-descript South West Jersey town. Contrary to some who use the word ghetto to represent the clientele here, it's simply not the case. Again, it's ethnically and racially diverse- mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends - all trying to have the best time they could during their time off from work!

I felt that there was plenty of parental supervision, I noticed only seniors/elderly family members sitting off on the sides and most parents/guardians aged from 18 to 60 were actively waking around and/or with their children in the water environment.

Paid $25 (due to googling ""Sahara Sam promo code"") per ticket and felt this was a very fair price for the amenities offered.

Took a star away because there needs be better instruction at the front door advising what needs to be done if you are either a 1)season ticket holder, 2) walk up purchaser, or 3) online purchaser and what you must do if you have bags with you. Basically you go inside if you already have your tickets with or without bags to convert them to wristbands at the counter. Everyone with bags must go inside for a bag check. Someone outside would have saved about 8 minutes of my families time and probably the time of countless other confused souls.

The facility appearing well maintained overall - paint fresh and vivid, not chipping, no rust visible.

It was clean. The water appeared clean and hygienic relative to the amount of people present.

It gets busy, I would say about 90% capacity, the earlier the better. The ability to use the outdoor facility helps balance the flow between areas.

The smell of chlorine is there, I'd say play inside for a bit, go outside get some air, then come back in...remember - your in a normally enclosed area (even tho the roof does open).

Staff appeared helpful with flow of smaller children, life guards were attentive to children in water areas - felt safe. Seen many genuine smiles from The staff.

Didn't purchase food there - left it in the car and went out to eat it at the car, no food or drinks allowed from the outside inside the facility - which makes sense to protect their business interest - but they let you do as you place in the parking area! Plus, their price list is available as a picture on Yelp - scroll through - and if you don't
Like the prices bring sandwiches or go down the
Block to McDonalds - otherwise deal with the prices and food quality - it's a water park not a gourmet restaurant!

We will go back again as it is a good value for $25 each ticket (use the discount promo codes online)!! 

The kids loved it. No complaints from them.

And you get drinks at the bar and can bring them throughout the facility (Long Island Iced Tea $9.50 - best value for alcohol served).","2016-07-04 00:39:26"

A nice wooden bar to your left upon walking in, with small tables dispersed around the perimeter of the restaurant.   They offer a solid selection of whiskey & bourbon at reasonable prices.  The bar staff was very knowledgeable and will help you make a decision if your not a connoisseur.

"GfVHOrD-RVr2xZr5dxRvVA",5,"Hands down the best place I've ever gone to.  Now that I've moved to DC I hardly know where to go!  The first time I walked in, I had a lot of long hair that I knew I wanted to get rid of.  I wanted to go short -- not bob short, but short-short.  I had a few pictures of cuts I liked, but  no real idea of what would look good on me.  I sat down with Ellen, we chatted for a bit, and she soon suggested a style that I thought sounded promising.  And it ended up being more than promising--it was fantastic!  I loved it, my friends loved it, and even my family liked it (high praise).  It's a cliche to point out, maybe, but i got more compliments from strangers on my hair the months after getting it cut than I'd heard for years prior.

I eventually decided to grow it back out, and kept coming back to V Vegaz and Ellen for trims and cuts along the way.  I think we can all admit that growing hair out from above your jaw to below your collarbones is going to take a very long time and be irritating no matter what.  However, working with Ellen made that a far less frustrating and a far more flattering process than it would have been otherwise.  

As for more general things, the atmosphere of the salon is lovely--very well-designed without being intimidating or cold.  I never had any trouble scheduling appointments, and, thanks to the receptionist Michelle's help, was even able to fit a trim at the last minute when I accidentally showed up to the salon on the wrong day.

If you're looking for a great cut, not just a good cut, this is it.","2012-05-28 23:59:50"
"dbfxPn8pLxsuWrKlbF63pQ",5,"Trident never disappoints for me.  It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.

If you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.

Also delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entrée sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.

I love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.

The other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.

For non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.

They also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.

Word of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.  So plan accordingly.","2018-10-04 15:46:03"

"0VvSpwLzL7j6kFmoX8vRyg",4,"I was staying downtown for work, and I needed to grab lunch before a meeting.  I walked into Sun Diner, a pretty new spot at the time, because there aren't a ton of restaurants downtown with awesome reviews.  This one looked intriguing, and I love breakfast food any time of day.  I loved the decor and layout!  Really fitting for Music City, delightfully retro.  Most of the seating is at the counter, which is casual and laid back.  

The food was pretty good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.  Prices are on par for downtown, touristy Nashville.  Steep but expected.

My one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.  I kept bumping into people entering the restaurant while I waited.

Overall, I'd say this is a safe bet when you're downtown, and I think it would taste even better at 3am.  After all, it's a 24-hour diner!","2017-03-15 19:21:35"

"Ky_JL3ITzAOnSGZmRiiiWw",5,"There's a reason why they're # 1:  They're the Best!

My daughter [a UCSB student] needed a short-term public storage unit because her new apartment wasn't available to move-in, before the lease of her old place expired.  So, I researched online for some local businesses.  Only Public Storage is up front about what they charge for their storage units and their website is user-friendly.

Others claim they have competitive prices, but what does that really mean?  Why don't they all clearly list their price for a particular size unit and tell you if it is available or not, without subjecting you to a sales pitch.  I inquired via their website, but they didn't have the courtesy to reply.

Public Storage was also the closest place to her Apt., UCSB, and offered the best deal too.  With their ""$1 for the 1st month promo"" it was a no-brainer decision.

Public Storage has got their act together and are very professional.  Does the competition allow you to reserve a unit without making a deposit?  Before I was finished registering online for their ""Express Check-In"" during the reservation process, their manager Kristine called to welcome me and answer any question that I might have.  That's impressive.  They also sent a written confirmation restating the size of the unit, your preference [of indoor vs. drive-up access], the cost, and your move-in date. 

When we were ready to move into the unit, Manny was our on-site team member, and he made the process hassle-free.  It was ready, and I had a choice of several that were available.  F.Y.I., if you want to keep a mattress clean, then buy one of their giant plastic storage bags.  Their office is well stocked with essential supplies and padlocks too, if you didn't have one already.

Moving out was just as easy, if not easier.  We came when it was convenient for us and left the unit clean and unlocked overnight.  I notified Public Storage online of our move-out.  They inspected the unit, closed out our account, and sent me a receipt.  [I didn't even need to re-visit the place, but did since I was in the area a few days later.  I just wanted to tell Kristine and Henry, who greeted me, what a pleasure it was doing business with them.

The decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. 

The menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. 

Overall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. 

BTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a ""cheese"" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've ""been around"" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real.

And it wasn't even a fruity chick drink, so it made me happy. Strange to find a surfing bar theme in downtown New Orleans, but they made it work!","2011-09-26 06:35:19"

"HuKsIDJr_0XTAOvgHvb1Qg",2,"Food was excellent, server was good. Had purchased a groupon ($35 off bill) earlier that day, as we were leaving town the next day. When we went to pay the bill, the server told us that she couldn't find our groupon and we had to write down the voucher number for her. A few minutes later, the manager came to the table and said ""your groupon isn't in our system so you can't use it"" and walked away. We had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it. Again, the manager was very rude and just said ""what does your groupon say- it says you have to have a reservation"" and walked away again. So, yes, the fine print said reservations required, but this is not the type of place I can see anyone making a reservation, and they never mentioned that until they couldn't find it in the system. Also, I would have been fine with this if the manager had handled it politely. His immediate aggressive attitude was very insulting and made it ver uncomfortable to the other guests who weren't paying for the bill.","2015-01-05 00:45:30"

Wait Staff Review 
The main reason I leave this bad review is because of the banquet staff. Our waitress was very rude and not accommodating. Our waitress ignored one of our members could not have asparagus or he would die. We mistakenly forgot to get a meal card for his allergy we had on file for the conference. She said he did not have a card (piece of paper) that would not allow her to make any adjustments or alternations to the meal. This is a conference of almost 5,000 ppl and not all 5,000 were at the banquet. A vegetarian plate could not be swiped out for the chicken and asparagus plate? Or a plate brought out without asparagus? This makes no sense to me. After she told us no, I asked another waiter and he explained to me no accommodations without a card because of their supervisors. He apologized but said it was not allowed (he was nice). Once our waitress saw I asked him, she scolded me and said she was my waitress and not to ask anyone else. Then proceeded NOT to attend to our table of 12 people the rest of the night. Empty water glasses and plates, were then taken up by another waiter much later. I can understand that they have certain rules placed on them by their superiors but the way she spoke to us and reacted was up acceptable. Not to mention we contacted AFLV and they said they received similar complaints from people. So JW Marriott please have a conversation with your wait staff, we can understand policy but somethings are exceptions or at least speak to people with respect.","2018-02-11 13:59:29"

We walked in the restaurant and were seated at a table by the bar immediately.  There were two people at the bar and two other tables seated.  The host (may have also been our server) asked us what we wanted to drink.  Ten minutes later, the same man came back to our table, told us he had a ""brain fart"" and forgot what we ordered to drink.  We politely gave him our drink order again, and after at least five more minutes, we still hadn't seen him again, and we left.  The bartender, who walked past us at least 3 times, was at the bar on her IPad about 3 feet away from us when we walked out.  We gave them a second chance, and we won't be back.

"gT9XRjpfOyxNuAQzuXu0nw",4,"Not sure if they were on their best behavior because of the influx of Fantasies in Chocolate people coming out for the afterparty, or if they have just righted the ship that was off course or what.  But my experience at Lex Nightclub was just fine.

We didn't have bottle service or anything special.  We had some free tickets because of going to Fantasies in Chocolate so we expected to go in, check out the place and then head out.  But instead we stayed for about an hour.  I did my white man overbite shuffle and then let my wife tear up the dance floor looking smoking hot and happy.  Nothing makes a man happier than seeing his wife enjoying herself.

We didn't get any drinks because we knew we would be driving soon enough, but I did get a few waters and the bar staff was super friendly and helpful and hardworking.  The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.

The music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.

This by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to ""da club"".

After doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.

Oh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy ""eyecandy"" up on platforms everywhere.  So he will be looking, it's only natural, if this will get you in a fight, go elsewhere.","2014-10-27 19:54:17"

I chose to get one of the specials, the Salmon, and WOW was I impressed. It was cooked so perfectly. A slight crunch on the outside (not burnt) and juicy on the inside. It was honestly the best salmon I ever had. There was a corn succotash on top and it came with orzo, because I can't have gluten I chose to sub broccoli.

If this wasn't the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat, I really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is. 

I ate steak, delicious steak, instead of a grilled cheese at Elmo-Bites. Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. 

The servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, ""Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?"" Swiftly, he responded, ""Let's do it. Go big or go home.""

All the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. 

Being from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.

My only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries. An additional side of something small like corn or rice, would have made it even-steven. But I loved my meal. I'd go back.","2015-09-09 18:46:42"

The solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the ""champagne"" was horrid, but it was New Year's Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.

This was previously a review that provided a less than desirable rating for the Peppermill.  I am writing this as an amendment to the previous review (below) and changing its one star rating, as I was contacted by a very nice gentleman in management (Dave).  Through him, the Peppermill has taken a very large step in an effort to change my opinion of itself as ""the premier resort"" in Reno. Dave has helped to restore my faith in the resort, its management and the people there. We will update again after the next stay

03/01/2012 (original Review)
I try not to bash anyone or anyplace!
Ok, well I surprised my wife with our first alone getaway since having our son 3.5 years ago. I booked on the phone a room with a spa tub, mountain or pool view and 1 king bed, got a confirmation # sent by email. 
We got there and they gave us a room with no tub (not romantic and not cool) so we go straight back to the counter.
They inform us they cannot give us what we ordered as there are none left. Why the hell do we book rooms and get confirmation numbers then, what a crock. 
So they are able to give me a room on the ground floor with a grand view of a nice fat brick wall, 2 beds and a bath. How charming a view of a brick wall, these guys really know how to make good on a reservation for our first romantic getaway in years... 
As this is what they have, we kind of have to take it or stay in our current room, so we take it, big mistake!!!!!
It is late so without checking everything, we run to get a bite to eat. After a late dinner we come back to the bedroom and I pull down the bed covers, to my amazement there is a big fat hair on my pillow. Great now I have to wonder if the room is clean or not. 

Guess what, they have no other rooms left so we get the hairy deluxe room. 

I waited 4 days before posting this as I left comment cards with the Peppermill and was told the manager takes these things serious and makes things right. I have not heard anything as yet, so am posting this review. 

For the ""premier"" place in Reno, this is sad. I would rather stay at a place that provides what was ordered and is clean.

"9qfb0MSXznLa_cu-TAYKWw",3,"Eh. As others were saying, the design is pretty bad. It took an hour to get out of the parking garage. Elevators take forever, so we took the stairs, just to be greeted by a locked door.

I'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.

I guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.

As far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. 

The best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. 
The Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.
There's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.

There are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session. However, I guess that wouldn't stop two year-olds from being there.","2017-06-06 19:00:15"

"cZLCXIS7WpBwfDQIKSOh_Q",4,"This place is like Old NY meets the Godfather meets Golden Girls.

The parking lot is pretty small and from what we gathered, is always packed.  Droves of people coming in and out, most looking like pros who have been doing this for decades. 

Upon walking in the market, nobody greets you, and nobody seems to care you're there.  Why you ask?  Because it's an old Italian market that lets their goods do the talking.  The front room are where the meats live, but that's not what we were after.  

Give me the sandwiches...

It was a good thing I decided to check out the menu online because once you go back and to the left it gets real - fast.  You pick your deli number (something so foreign to this Atlanta girl, but seems like it's a must here in Florida) and wait for the chaos to begin.  They take orders faster than you would imagine and before you can say ""Forgettaboutit"" you're up.  Slightly panicked at the fast pace of it all I promptly ordered 5 sandwiches (please feel free to judge me).  

While we waited for our babies to arrive we perused the prepared food section and decided on a fennel salad and chicken pasta.

In less than 10 minutes our sandwich babies were born (no really, they were so heavy, it was awesome!).  We also grabbed a fresh loaf of bread on the way to check out (please  grab yourself one, you can thank me later).

They gave us our sandwiches in a shopping basket and when my friend asked the cashier where he could put it, she said fairly dryly ""Where you got it""

We didn't even mind.  We were just here for the sandwiches.

Out of all of the sandwiches, 3 were meh, but two standouts were the Hot Italian and the Boars Head BLT.  The magical bread that the BLT is on makes the sandwich a homerun.  it's big, messy, and delicious.  The fennel salad was not very good IMO, and the chicken pasta was just okay.  

Oh, and about that baguette --- we couldn't eat it fast enough.  

Overall, I won't be running back, but I will definitely return with modified expectations!","2017-10-24 20:28:23"

"-wjJGDUPMv6qdvxVSmhSsg",3,"Was really looking forward to giving this place 5 stars for service and excellent pricing until one incident. Let me tell you why I would like to give them 5stars originally. The company phone representative person who helped me book my appointment was very helpful and courteous throughout the call. They send you a friendly reminder for your appointment so you don't forget. They give you a price quote up front. The price is reasonable. I had my entire windshield replaced and installed for $240 compare to my car insurance deductible of $500 if I were to use my insurance. When I arrived at the location they greet you with a smile and get you set up really quickly and explain the whole situation before they get started (basically keeping you informed). Now to why it is a 3-stars. So upon dropping off my car I got a time estimate of 2 hrs...which is longer than what other reviewer says...that's fine cause every situation is different I guess. Before they got started on my car a bunch of ppl started to come in and they had similar appointment time to mine. So i decided to go watch them work on my car because 1) i didn't want them to go out of order on who's car they are working on and 2) it makes time go by quicker 3) I was curious to see how they take out an entire windshield. I watched for a good hour before walking to go get food for the remainder of the next hour. Before I left the guy was pretty much half way done. I took a one hour food excursion and when I got back it looked like he didn't do any work and it was at the same stage as before I left for food. Wtf is the first thought came to mind. There was another guy working on a different car during the same time as my car and they were at the same pace before I left. When I got back the other guy was already on his second car taking the window out of the second car. How is my car look like nothing was done. The only thing that possible look like it was done was maybe he vacuumed the dust away around the windshield. I asked the second guy do you know how long it is going to take (because the guy working on my car wasn't anywhere to be found)...his reply idk you have to go ask your technician. When my technician got back his reply was 30 more minutes (in a not so happy tone). At this point I wasnt really happy but just waited to get the heck out of there. On a positive note he did get it done in 30min while I waited and watched him worked on my car. I was thinking the entire time that if I hadn't go to get food my car would have been done in 30min. This could have easily been a 5stars experience IF minus the attitude and GIVE an explanation to why the work was backed up on my car specifically.","2017-04-30 04:55:11"

Then there's the food. Honestly, everything I've eaten here has been mediocre. The Devour Downtown was especially disappointing.

What they advertise the rooms looking like is not even close to what they actually look like. The lobby was very nice, the service was pretty good. But the rooms could use updating considering what they are showing on the website. The cafe in the hotel was delicious great breakfast/brunch menu.

Having rented a different car every week for more than four months, so far, I have had what I consider an ""executive"" vehicle only once or twice--pretty poor percentage. Lately all vehicle options in the ""executive"" area have more than 10,000 miles, with at least one over 30,000. The manager has no interest in customer service, preferring to quote rules and refuse to discuss options, rather than work with customers to resolve problems in a creative manner. I have been significantly overcharged, having to wait  for a resolution nearly 30 minutes, nearly missing a flight. The wait for a shuttle has been as long as 20 minutes, and I've been taken to the wrong terminal by an insistent shuttle driver resulting in a 40 minute journey back to the correct terminal and a missed flight.

"V_2-fmjJTJ_BCruAJfLijw",5,"Full disclosure on my review as Marathon Music Works was the hosting sponsor for the recent Yelp Helps event to which they went above and beyond to cater to Yelp, other sponsors, 15 nonprofit organizations, and attendees to ensure that everyone was pleased and had a positive experience. From an event planner's viewpoint, I was over the moon happy with how professional Telisha Cobb (co-owner) and the entire MMW team were. (especially during their opening week!)
I hope to host another event here soon!

However, I am also reviewing this as an attendee for the Wanda Jackson show the following night. 

Yes, I said it... the fan-frickin-tastic Wanda Jackson who is still very much a charming and incredibly talented little minx on stage. What a great way to launch a brand new venue with a music legend. 

This gorgeously executed venue is massive with over 14,000 square feet of event space that can accommodate around 1500 standing attendees. The design layout is very thoughtful with 2 bar and restroom areas (on both Yelp Helps and Wanda Jackson, there was never more than a few person wait for the ladies loo. Shocking, right?) I also very much appreciate the front box-office area that is open at specific times for consumers to purchase tickets and avoid the sometimes highway robbery that is known as the ticket processing business. Ample free parking on the street and available secure parking lot spots are also available for a reasonable $5. 
The icing on the cake for me is the coat check area. Ladies, you know what I mean... the worst thing ever is to attend a concert or event and have to drag your parka around like Linus's blankie the whole dang night... our husbands and boyfriends have had enough.

If you're lucky enough to make your way to the VIP Mezzanine, the view overlooking the stage and entire venue is quite splendid too. 

As some of you know, I am a huge advocate for charitable causes and MMW is committed to making a difference in this arena. Their participation in Yelp Helps was impressive but they don't just stop there...each month MMW will spotlight one local nonprofit organization and collect items and donations at the front entrance during events and shows. To entice attendees to give, they will collect email addresses from those who do to register them for ticket-giveaways at the end of the month. Nurses For Newborns are the current beneficiary. 

For all of you musicians, the state of the art sound system is music to your fan's ears while you entertain us on the over-sized stage which can be seen clearly from any angle in the crowd. I was also impressed with the artist's quarters that include 3 dressing rooms with a full bath area. As a dame who has been stuck in more than a few shotty ""green rooms"" in my lifetime, the accommodations here are like The Ritz Carlton compared to the grime that you all are used to in small to midsized venues.

"-QQKeWd-H6zHKqwjd3fU5A",1,"Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible.","2017-01-15 04:11:08"

"Xu2WtxUIDQXb-rwkXWGAng",4,"I first heard of this place from a dude I know, and then I heard Craig LaBan called it the best burger in the city. That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be ""that guy"" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.

I got the ""Village Burger"" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.

The duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.

The whiskey list is HUGE. 

It's so small inside they don't have ""sections"" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? 

 I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger.","2016-08-03 23:22:56"

I asked the woman from the kitchen sending gumbo for water she said as kinda surprised and said"" you want water?"" Oh yeah should I is she dumb? 

The bar tender was busy counting money and cold as as ice, the other guy grilling oyster is ridiculous as well. And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.

And the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.

"yNAmr9WPJjC05wTXiIap9A",4,"During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. 

During dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: 

Tortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. 

Shrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. 

Sauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. 

Beans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. 

Horchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. 

Pina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. 

Taqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?","2011-08-25 03:46:43"
"Gp7IuGPQzf2dpITBhOJQIA",1,"Good food, but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff, and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room.

"cOfdFe1jDohXfTfSymf4Ng",4,"I can't overstate how much I love Crumb De La Crumb's cafe. This is my go-to, absolute favorite lunch spot in all of Tennessee. I live in Mt Juliet but travel the 30 miles to Bellevue to indulge in the delightful fare. My personal favorite? Charleston She Crab soup and chicken salad on a croissant. Heaven I tell you, heaven! 

If you haven't checked this place out yet, you're seriously missing out. Go now!!

Reason for an imperfect review: Two things.
1. The check out process is usually very time consuming. I normally wait 5-10 minutes in line before being able to pay my bill and leave. You have to go up front and pay which is fine but usually, the patrons in line are slowly picking out different desserts to purchase at the same time. There's only one cashier, usually the same lady. I don't know her name but she always seems down or unhappy. Which is always frustrating because the servers are usually very sweet and helpful. 

2. I wrote a review several years ago on their old Yelp name ""The Cottage Cafe"", but they have since changed their official name to Crumb De La Crumb to keep in sync with the dessert side of their business. Maybe I've always had bad luck with the desserts but I've tried many of the bars and cupcakes and always found a serious fault with them. For instance, a red velvet cupcake I had was extremely dry (like it had been baked a few days before) and the icing wasn't as sweet as you'd hope for a cream cheese icing. 

TL;DR The cafe side is phenomenal but the check-out process and desserts are lacking.","2015-03-19 01:48:31"

The nurses and doctors were terrific.  The cost was obviously a little more then my local vet, but being that it is an emergency room, I expected this.  The wait time (about 2 hours total I was there) was reasonable since it is an emergency room and they had some serious cases come in while I was there. ( I did chuckle at one of the other reviews who wouldn't give 5 stars because they waited an hour- its an emergency room!)  I wish my wait in the human emergency room was this short.

"UJmD1Y8X7J8pmCAjnXG9Mw",1,"Wednesday night 8/24/16. Talk about bad.. Wow... All I can say. This place has taken a massive backward step since my wife and I use to frequent the location often while she was in hospo at Ruths down the road...The girl at the bar was a completely unprofessional.. Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason. When we asked for the bill after 1 drink she knew she was in the shit so much she crossed her name out on the receipt to avoid detection (3 times despite us asking specifically for her name and a full unaltered receipt for my records) she  kept  giving us torn off versions  without her name or the name of the place) 

We visited after a cards game. I had taken my team out to celebrate wins at our organization and I was shocked at how my team was treated. No sooner had we arrived - 1pm - with [ 9 ] people , we were given the cold shoulder... The door says open until 3 am  but it was like the girl at the bar resented us for arriving.... 
Dark hair girl: was so rude she basically told us she didn't want to serve us. Everyone was happy but no-one was drunk.. She was extremely rude and short with everyone. We had chosen to leave PBR to Calicoes because I like the place  ?!? Weird...
The police man [ Willis ] at the bar was professional when we complained but said he could do anything,  even he seamed perplexed by the dark haired girls attitude...  Even the other bar guy was saying she should chill.

They have a bunch of fresh quick favorites in the steam table like roast pork and yellow rice or black beans and rice, but today I picked something I have had there before and loved, chicken fingers. I know crazy right? But it's the best and always fresh made. They make it like my grandma, fresh breaded and quick fried. That and a side of rice and nice big bowl of their amazing Spanish Bean soup/ garbanzo and I am in culinary heaven. This is my go to place for great comfort food. Cubans are pretty good here too.

The food, which changes seasonally, is always perfect. It is an experience by itself. I ordered a ribeye and it was the best cut of meat I've ever had in my life. Cooked perfectly. Seasoned and oddly breaded, which sounds unappealing until you taste it. Not only was it one of the best steaks I've ever had, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. 

The fact that Chef Baldino spends his time walking around, shaking hands with people before they leave and having real, genuine conversations, adds to the already glowing ambiance. And the staff is well-versed and warm.

"RaQTYbHYXPJQKXF2cS7YyA",5,"I've been in the Carollwood/Tampa area since 1988 and it surprises the heck out of me that there are still great places tucked away that I've not only not been to but also not really heard of.  I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.  
Gio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..  
We got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left, around 7:00 pm, another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.  
My wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn't
My wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  ""yes, indeed"".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  ""excellent, creamy, flavorful"".
My entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini sautéed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of sautéed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.  
I finished with a double expresso.  

Service:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.  

Atmosphere: great, simple decorations and pictures, background Italian music at this time of day.  

Price:  somewhat pricey but worth it for a special day or that once a month visit.  

Going back:  Definitely.  While we were there a friend of mine facebooked and said he would be in the Tampa area next month and wanted to hook up.  Why not here?","2014-11-13 00:36:34"

I don't know which I liked better, the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich.  He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don't think is possible.

The sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.  Pro tip: check out coupons4indy.com before you go!

Can't wait til next time!","2014-10-11 16:34:28"
"Sb_X0QUiPQb-HXWNVIW1-Q",1,"This is the worst Hertz location. I rent a car once or twice a week for work and have been to a lot of Hertz locations. The customer service is poor, the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas. Let me share with you some lessons learned, which the Hertz people should tell you but don't:

1. Before you leave the rental counter, make sure you have a parking ticket to exit the garage.
2. I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a ""little less than full"". How the heck do you return a car ""a little less than full""? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping. 
3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right, up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars, which are outdoors. So, if it is raining or snowing, good luck.
4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area.
5. Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total, don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time.","2013-02-22 04:19:50"
"hrvmOcxAY9_IiAwAOJZ9Mg",5,"This place was as quaint as can be, right in the middle of Doylestown inside the Doylestown Inn. The vibe is pretty cool with a speakeasy touch- mirrors and chandeliers hanging around for sale. Service was excellent, food came out super fast and was delicious!! We made reservations ahead and they had our table ready 10 mins before we got seated. Ordered our drinks and food and it took maybe 10 mins before the food was out. The arugula salad with chipotle shrimp and goat cheese was amazing!","2018-05-28 21:07:50"

The cheese steak was quite good, tender tasty slices of steak and a warm cheesy sauce on a delicious roll. The crab fries came out hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The service was prompt and attentive which I liked. Very clean and a very nice sports atmosphere. I will be back.","2018-01-10 02:17:56"

"00J9BRuGkK4UOpZIiHpKew",4,"I just moved to NOLA from Houston and was lamenting the lack of good Mexican restaurants to my friend when he suggested this place. 

SO glad he did! The queso was SO good...I filled up on that before we got our main dish. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and while they were good, they use a red sauce instead of a cream sauce. I would have preferred a cream sauce but these weren't bad at all. My husband ordered beef fajitas and those were good, too.

I had a few margaritas and huh....that's funny. I really don't recall much else about the place.

Oh yeah! It's good for groups. There were 6 of us and we all sat around a table laughing, cutting up, drinking the strong, strong margaritas, and eating the delicious queso.  Good service, good food, good times. I'll definitely be back!","2012-12-04 21:50:46"
"94hSTwcWkbuN6tVzKRcMCw",3,"Eh. 

Visited Carmine's on a weekend trip to Missouri after reading the its reviews on Yelp. Can't say I had the same experience as other yelpers this time around...

While the service was spot-on (I don't think my water glass was ever less than 3/4 full), the quality of food just didn't meet my ""steakhouse"" expectations. My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn't anything ""special"" about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland. My bad I suppose for ordering seafood in a restaurant known for steaks, although my brother's medium steak came out practically bleeding and was sent back for a second round on the grill. 

One positive... the toasted ravioli. Yummm! Wish I had just ordered a second plate for dinner.","2008-04-29 04:05:43"
"EBYnP3-H0V6tIo60NBTvQw",1,"Visited tonight for take-out.  16 bucks for the tutto du Mari, which had 6 small shrimp and a bunch of nasty canned clams, most of which were so mushed up I couldn't tell what they were.  No seasoning except salt and tons of pepper.  Sauce tasted like flour and water.  Salad was limp and soggy.  Bread was ok, but basically a giant unheated roll.  16 bucks for one bite of salad that I spat out, six small shrimp, a bite of bread, and 2 forkfuls of pasta.  The rest went into the trash.  If I hadn't gotten take-out, entire meal would have gone back.

Gooey butter cake was ok but not particularly fresh, and t-ravs were edible (but easy to get frozen so hard to mess up).  Hubby had the chicken portobello pasta and reported it bland but inoffensive.","2014-11-30 00:52:27"

Food was fabulous!! I had the chicken salad (which was recommended) and it did not disappoint!! Prices were very reasonable.

"ReIL-9IXONDfkGA3jadHlg",4,"Came here for lunch on a very cold day, convenient location right around the corner from my office. A had a few co-workers tag along so we ordered to-go.

It's nice they have two options for ordering, a self serve kiosk as well as though a cashier. We all opted for the kiosk. 

Really interesting the deluxe pho is the same price as all of the others. I found this as a bonus because I prefer multiple goodies over choosing only one protein.

Service was quick but we found ourselves waiting around for those who ordered bahn mi sandwiches. When we got back to the office everything was packaged great, no spills etc. I liked that they give you all the sprouts, noodles, basil etc in a separate bowl...however you'll find at the bottom of that bowl is a tiny plastic cup of hoisin. Not sure why they decide to hide it at the bottom, but some of my overeager coworkers poured their broth in before fishing it out!

I was really happy with the pho I thought it was super flavorful and I will definitely be back soon!","2018-02-01 19:42:23"

We got the Nashville hot cauliflower (outstanding), roasted duck (outstanding), grilled peaches (outstanding) and the scallops (above average). It got a bit pricey, but these tapas have more substance than a lot of other ones I've had in the past. Wednesday happy hour is half price drinks and $25 bottles of wine.","2016-07-14 20:22:31"

We walked in to a nice, pleasant atmosphere and were seated quickly. The ambience and decor are great and it's not overly loud. 
Our sushi chef, Isiah, made some nice suggestions right off the bat a they were delicious. The nigiri was very fresh and full of flavor. 
My favorites of the night were the ceviche appetizer, the pink lady and the albacore. 
Will put on the top of my list for sushi.","2017-10-02 03:22:03"

"vw_ZNbSmRRnNR8TCxwOMiw",4,"So I came here after all the hoopla on the foobooz site and because Matyson is an awesome byob(and who doesn't love delicious noodles). I have to say, had the burger and pork belly buns and they were excellent. Also had the BBQ crisp appetizer that had a great flavor yet it needed something to soak up the sauce. Finally had the lamb braised noodles and they were great. Again I wanted to soak up every ounce of the sauce. They should go against the norm and serve a nice crusty bread- blasphemy you might say but seriously something must be done to soak up these flavors.

Now onto the bad part, the prices.  Way too expensive for everything. Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles Isn't that far away and their delicious noodles are 3-5 bucks depending on either the peanut or soy pork sauce; Cheu's prices are around 11-15, and small to boot. Also sampan isn't far away with a great priced happy hour. I know Cheu is just starting up, so hopefully after a time they will be a little more affordable.

This place is great with a comfy feel and a warm and inviting staff.  I will be back, just not often or I'll be broke.","2013-04-11 00:08:16"
"By8WlqTsXoV46IMPWwtMrw",4,"After trying the pizza here on Halloween night when we arrived I did not think I would give it a second try. Pizza that night was bad. Card board crust and No flavor. Short staffed and our poor waitress was completely overwhelmed. 

On my last night being tired and not wanting to go all over NOLA trying to find the perfect meal we decided to give it another try. So I went with the simple cheddar burger and sweet potato fries. My boss went with the oyster po boy. Let just say this was one of the best meals I had all week. My boss raved about her oyster po boy (huge portion).  My burger was juicy and very nicely seasoned. Sweet potato fries were excellent. The sushi looked fresh and beautifully made. Would have tried but could not eat another bite. Just goes to show that most places can have an off night. Glad I gave this place a second chance.","2015-12-05 11:37:33"

"Naz6TaEzsRBOT__yIvdErQ",1,"My Room was disgusting. The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at.
